    "SummaryEnglish": "On a planet far, far away from Earth, there reigns a kingdom overflowing with smiles. \r\n \r\nPrincess Yuki is twelve years old and beginning to ride the roller coaster of emotions that comes with adolescence. Each day brings with it tears, laughter, and even a little romance. The palace is full of fun, and the vassals who serve her there add color to her life. There's Layla the tutor, Izana the political adviser, Harold the Grand Master, and of course Joshua, her childhood friend and close aide.\r\n \r\n\"Yuki! As long as you have the will and passion, you can do anything!\" says Joshua. \r\n \r\n\"Ugh. That again?! Joshua, you need to act more dignified!\" she replies.\r\n \r\nSeventeen-year-old Stella is a brilliant warrior. Even though she is cool as a cucumber, she never fails to smile. That's because smiling is essential to life.\r\n \r\nThis is a story about two girls born on a distant planet.",
