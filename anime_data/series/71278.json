    "SummaryEnglish": "Hellsing is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kouta Hirano. An Anime Series was produced by Gonzo.  Directed by Umanosuke Iida, and it was broadcast on Japan's Fuji Televison. // Plot: Vampires exist. It is the duty of Hellsing, an organization sponsored by the British government, to hide that frightening fact and protect the blissfully unaware populace. Along with its own personal army, Hellsing also has a few secret weapons. Alucard, an incredibly powerful vampire, has been controlled by Hellsing for years. Although he dislikes being a servant to the Hellsing family, he certainly enjoys his job as Hellsing’s vampire exterminator. Seras is a fledgling vampire and a former police woman. Although reluctant to embrace her new self, she is still a valuable member of the organization. Integra Hellsing, the current leader, is usually fully capable of fulfilling her duty, but lately, vampire activity has been on the rise. Unfortunately, the cause is more alarming than anything she could have imagined...",

The remaining Hellsing members are at the decoy spot of the meeting, battling ghouls of the S.A.S. from Red House Vertigo.  Due to the vast coverage of the \"terrorist attacks\" and the required secrecy of the undead, Hellsing organization is pinned by an unknown source in the media as the terrorist organization itself.  The British military is called in to stop these \"terrorists.\"  Fargason purposely gets himself killed so he looked like a terrorist, preventing the media from investigating the London Tower destruction any further, thus keeping both the vampires and Hellsing out of the public eye (for now).

While that is happening, Alucard was making his way through the tower to meet with Incognito for one big battle.",
