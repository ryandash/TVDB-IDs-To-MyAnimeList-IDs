She is then questioned about training, and that the person she is speaking to wants to discipline her, in which she questions the effectiveness of it. A rope is then given to her, and Tomoe is then tied up and attempts to free herself. After breaking free, she notes that this type of training is different for her, and that she is quite excited from it. Now hoisted upside down, Tomoe is repeatedly whipped, and soon after she is doused in a pool of water repeatedly. During the process, she comes to the realization that enlightenment can only be attained through overcoming pain. Afterwards, laying upon the ground, she understands that true enlightenment can only be obtained through the new training.",

Her clothes keep appearing and disappearing, despite her remarks that she is not fatigued. She proceeds to prepare the dinner, which Airi claims will offer full nourishment. After stirring the broth, she then searches for the gecko eyeballs, and blames Melona for misplacing them. While searching, she notices a live gecko moving across the floor, and she hurries to catch it, but it gets caught under the cabinet and Airi soon catches it. After adding the eyeballs to the broth, she begins to clean the castle, also blaming Melona for the mess and wondering where the other maids would ever arrive. She then tends to the artificial life-form the Swamp Witch created, and in the process, trips and spills the broth out of the pot, over her and the life-form. While in such a predicament, she offers the Swamp Witch to have a taste.",
