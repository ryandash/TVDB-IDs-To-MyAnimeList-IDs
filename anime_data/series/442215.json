In search of a long-lost lake, Sheriff Rao asked the king of the demons for help...and got the king's son, Beelzebub, and his assistant, Thief. Together, the unlikely trio sets off across the desert, facing dragons, bandits, and the deadliest foe of all... the King's army itself!\r\n\r\nAdapted in full CGI, the Sand Land movie condenses Toriyama’s manga into a feature-length adventure. (The anime re-tells this same story in traditional animation across its first six episodes before continuing with an original arc.)",
