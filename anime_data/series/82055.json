        "eng": "Kenji Tomosaka moved to this coastal town when he was a child. At that time, the sea spread in front of him was shining like lamune, reflecting the sunlight of the summer. There, he met a girl.\r\n\r\nHer name is Nanami Konoe, who lived next door. Her room is only 1 to 2 meters away beyond the veranda. Their rooms were so close as if they were within their arms’ reach.\r\n\r\nAs the time passed, the seasons came round, their memories have been accumulated with time. They think of their normal lives and common relationship as precious things.\r\n\r\nThe sun begins to shine strongly, cicadas begin to buzz, and the sky clears up… Here comes the summer, again! For Kenji and Nanami, it is normal summer, but it has special meaning…",
        "jpn": "幼い頃に海沿いのこの町へ引っ越してきた主人公・友坂健次。目の前に広がる海は夏の日差しを照り返してラムネ色に輝いていた。\r\n健次はその海で一人の少女と出会う。\r\n少女の名前は近衛七海、健次の新しい家のすぐ隣に住んでいた。ベランダを挟んで、1、2メートルの距離、二人の部屋は手を伸ばせば届くほど近かった。\r\n季節は巡り、時間は流れ、二人の思い出はその年月と共に積み重ねられていく。なんでもない日常、あたりまえの関係……二人にはそれがとても尊いものだった。日差しが強くなり、蝉の鳴き声が聞こえ、空は青く澄み渡る――今年も夏が来た。\r\n健次と七海にとって当たり前の、だけど特別になる夏が。"
