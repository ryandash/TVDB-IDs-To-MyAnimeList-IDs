On the anniversary of this sacrifice, Barone and Clackey hold a conference, celebrating the union of Mazoku and humanity, and also Dan's feats.\r\n\r\nHowever, beneath that peace, an organization named Cardinal Sign advocates for the subjugation of Mazoku and human supremacy. They resort to terrorist attacks, violence, and have somehow obtained the 12 Zodiac X-Rares which ought to have vanished together with Dan.\r\n\r\nAmidst all this chaos, the bearers of the core's light feel a weird sensation, one that they've felt before. What could be the meaning of it, and what is the meaning behind the card that appeared within their decks, named \"The Clash King's Miracle\"?",
