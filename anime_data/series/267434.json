While discussing their future, Daichi introduces and registers them onto a recently popular website called \"Nicaea\", a video delivery site that allows people to see videos of their friend's death. Later, at the train station, they receive videos from Nicaea that show both of their deaths by an oncoming train at that exact station. Shortly after, before the train arrives, an earthquake occurs, causing the incoming train to derail and cause the same devastation they saw in the videos. On the verge of death, Nicaea offers Hibiki a second chance to live and a Demon Summoning App is forcefully downloaded into his phone. He and Daichi awake to find the station in ruins with most of the people dead. They then witness vile wolf-like creatures eating the corpses of the recently deceased. As the creatures turn their sights on them, rescued fellow classmate Io Nitta and Daichi inadvertently manifest demons from their cell phones which repeal the attacking creatures and allow them to escape. Making it back to the surface, they find that all of Japan has met with the same type of calamity before a strange organization takes over rescue operations, with the officer in charge pondering that humankind must survive \"Judgement Day\" even if it means using demons. With nowhere to go, the three decide to stick together and while waiting in Roppongi, the crowd is attacked by a demon called Dubhe. At the same time Hibiki receives another video showing Daichi's death, before Daichi bursts out of a corner with a delivery truck, intending to ram the demon. As the truck explodes, Hikibi, overcome with emotion, manifests his Avatar: Byakko, a tiger like demon which he manipulates and successfully destroys the Dubhe. In the aftermath, Daichi had been saved by another one of Io's demons, a pixie-like creature before the group is approached by the Japan Meteorological Agency: JP's. Elsewhere, a mysteriou",

Furthermore, he explains that the Dubhe was only one of 7 creatures called the Septentriones, each of which will appear in the next six days and should the JPs fail to defeat them then the world will disappear. As the JP's scientists begin to analyze the demon summoning app, Hibiki ponders on Yamato's words. The following day, Makoto releases them by taking them to an emergency shelter in Chūō. Here, it is discovered that a rumor of demons running amok is spreading. As Hikibi looks around at all of the refugees in a church, a winged-demon attacks and Hibiki summons Byakko to protect them. As Hibiki fights an endless swarm of the demons, Makoto shows up with her demon, Power and helps Hibiki defeat the winged-demons by destroying the rogue cellphone which had been summoning them.

Meanwhile in Nagoya, Jungo Torii and Airi Ban plan to infiltrate the JP's Nagoya Branch and retake it from the insurgents, although Airi also speculates that the JP's and the Resistance (Insurgents) had prior knowledge of the calamity. Elsewhere, Daichi and Io arrive in Nagoya to discover a Resistance camp handing out rations to civilians. Just then the camp is attacked by a swarm of rogue Legion demons. Daichi and Io summon their demons to intercept, however the swarm proves to be too large. Hibiki then appears in the background with the demon Suzaku and incinerates the swarm. As Hibiki leaves, Daichi demands from a nearby insurgent about his whereabouts to meet the insurgent leader, Ronaldo. Later at the Nagoya Branch, while an insurgent member and JP's medic, Otome Yanagiya argue over the state of affairs, Ronaldo appears with Hibiki and tells them that once all the Septentrione have been defeated, Yamato intends to create and become the leader of a new Meritocratic governing power in the aftermath. He further states that Yamato manipulated both the JP's and the Japanese Government for that ambition and when he, a former detective and JP's agent found out i.e. the \"Hotsuin Family Secret\": Yamato's plans and their predictions of the Septentriones, an attempt was made on his life.

As Ronado, Hibiki, Joe and Otome scout the Nagoya TV Tower in anticipation of the third Septentrione, Otome is hesitant to fight, especially when the JP's members such as herself have been told little to nothing about the Septentriones, although Ronaldo states that they should have no problem since their demons are much stronger than those used by JP's summoners. At the same time, as Hibiki ponders on Nicaea's origin and his power. Later, back at the Nagoya Branch, Otome and Hibiki have a brief discussion comparing Yamato's methods versus Ronaldo's methods. At this time, Daichi and Io arrive and tell Hibiki about his death clip while Makoto covers for them at the JP's Headquarters. Daichi and Io try to get Hibiki to return with them but he states that he can't because of the imminent Septentrione attack.

As everyone realizes that Alcor isn't using a cell-phone to control the demon, his origins are questioned by Hibiki to which he responds that he genuinely doesn't know, only that he isn't their enemy. Ronaldo has the Resistance summoners surround him with demons, but Bifrons easily incinerates them. Alcor goes on to calmly reveal that he is the creator of Nicaea and the Demon Summoning App, which he gave to humans as a means to fight the Septentriones, finally remarking that it allowed him to find a new \"Shining One\" in Hibiki. Ignoring the exchange, Yamato outlines that the next Septentrione will appear simultaneously at the spiritual barriers in Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka with Fumi adding that only high level demons would be strong enough to face them from now on. As he leaves, Yamato entrusts Osaka to Hibiki and leaves the Resistance in charge of the Septentrione in Nagoya although both Hibiki and Ronaldo state that they will not be Yamato's pawns. Hibiki concludes that at the end of the week long Septentrione battle, he will stop Yamato's plans. Afterwards, Alcor has an exchange with Bifrons and Botis on his actions which hint at stopping the \"Purge of Polaris\", while simultaneously as Yamato looks at having overused his power to control Ceberus, he recalls having rejected being the \"Shining One\" in favor of his ideals of stopping the \"Purge\" to Alcor in the past.

During the battle, Hibiki and Io received Ronaldo, Joe, and Otome's death clip that shows them died by Megrez' attack. Hibiki immediately tells Ronaldo to escape, but Ronaldo, Joe, and Otome decides to keep fighting since there are no summoners other than them that can defeat Megrez and resolves to avoid their fate like Hibiki does yesterday.

Later that day, Airi and Hinako are selected by Makoto and Fumi to challenge the next Septentrione. Much to Hibiki's reluctance to let them fight, Makoto explains that the Septentrione: Alioth is scheduled to manifest in the Earth's Ionosphere, and hence, specialized long ranged demons that only Hinako and Airi can summon, stand any chance of attacking it. As Alioth manifests in the ionosphere above the Sapporo region, Hinako summons the demon Shiva at the Sapporo TV Tower while Airi summons the demon Kama over at the Kaitaku Memorial Park. Utilizing an ancient myth, the JP's has some Legion demons, bind Kama in chains and take it into position in the air. Kama's appearance angers Shiva and he attacks it with the Pasupata ability.

As the group expresses concern on a battle plan, Yamato and Makoto reveal to their horror, Io inside a machine connected to the \"Brionac\" and their plan involving Io's sacrifice for Lugh.

As Lugh manifests, Yamato assumes control of it and releases the Ryumyaku Seal at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building to envoke the Dragon Stream - Shakko, while at the same time Io's mind begins to erode due to the strain of maintaining Lugh. Makoto explains that Shakko connects to a parallel universe and hence, is the only thing capable of banishing Mizar before it replicates infinitely and consumes their own universe, which Yamato manipulates through Lugh and thus defeats Mizar, just as Io's mind collapses. As Hibiki arrives at the Shinjuku National Stadium, Yamato orders him to destroy Lugh (Io) who has now gained control of Io's body.

                    "SummaryEnglish": "With the Trials of Polaris behind them, Alcor appears before Hibiki and co. and states that he intends on killing Yamato of his own free will and in doing so, entrusting the fate of the world to Hibiki, a battle which Yamato accepts. As their battle begins, Hibiki explains to Daichi and Io what would happen to the world if Yamato has his way after meeting with Polaris. While attacking Yamato with tentacles, Alcor realizes that Yamato had been steadily drawing him closer to the Tokyo Tower to enhance his use of the Ryumyaku. Afterwards, they take a short pause and exchange threats. Alcor expresses his support of Hibiki's future since he was treated as an actual person when with him, although Yamato retorts that Alcor should revert to being a mindless tool, and if so, he would be allowed to see his vision of the future. Just then, they both receive each other's death clips. Hibiki also receives their death clips and decides to keep his promise to Yamato by stopping him. Makato then makes her intentions of aiding Yamato until the end known, while lamenting on the pain she had brought to Hibiki and his friends under his orders. Makoto explains that before Yamato took her in, she had lost hope for the future, but he gave her a sense of purpose and brought a semblance of meaning into her life, and hence, is willing to aid him. As Hibiki tries to talk her out of it, along with Daichi and Io, receive her death clip, before she finally requests that they take care of Yamato before flying towards the battlefield on Power. As their battle continues, Alcor overwhelms Yamato, even easily destroying Cerberus. Although, since the Nicaea app is able to summon stronger demons based on a user's growth, Yamato tries to download stronger demons but not fast enough as it happens and is impaled in the leg by Alcor's tentacle attack. However, before Alcor can follow through and finish Yamato, he is distracted by Power before Makoto jumps in front of Yamato, acting as a human shield and is",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Not having anymore hesitation to fight, Hibiki reminds Yamato of their promise of defeating him and having an audience with Polaris. As their battle begins, Yamato notes that Hibiki is driven by his anger towards him and his warped reasoning behind sacrificing the lives of everyone. Although, Hibiki defends by stating that as a human, he cannot allow such injustice to prevail, causing Yamato to question his own humanity. As Hibiki defends an attack using Shakko's power, Yamato acknowledges him as an equal and reveals that their current situation had all been part of a grand scheme put into motion by Polaris since the moment of their births. However since Polaris itself is flawed by its own nature, it had left it up to humanity to decide amongst themselves who should survive until the end, whilst citing the anomaly of Alcor's nature as proof of this. This truth shocks Hibiki, but Yamato simply brushes it off as semantics in his goal to reshape the world into a meritocracy. As their debate continues, Hibiki desperately tries to defend the previous world that he and his friends fought so hard to protect, although Yamato remains adamant in his reasoning that those with power have a responsibility to erase the cancerous nature of humanity's current train of thought which had lead to world built on corrupt foundations while simultaneously exposing Hibiki's naivety. As Hibiki tries to explain how people can work together, he tries to get Yamato to realize that they had been friends all along because of their actions, but Yamato rejects the very notion of friendship, claiming that it is weak. As Yamato starts to show injuries from his previous battle with Alcor, Cerberus weakens a bit and Byakko utilizes the opportunity to eradicate them both with a lightning attack. Hibiki once again tries to assert his friendship with Yamato, claiming that they don't have a reason to fight although Yamato chooses not to accept this, since disregarding his goals after coming this far would",
