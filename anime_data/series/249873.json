She ends up taking over for a sick teacher at the local school, but she has no prior exposure to Kakashi or Seki. Kyouhei later sees Aki, who has been forced to care for a dog by Chihaya, and Aki finds himself strangely unable to disobey her. The Seki from earlier returns to try to ask Chihaya out, but she adamantly refuses and asks him to leave. She is later scolded for raising her hand to a son of the Kuga, which angers Kyouhei. Kyouhei vows to protect her, but she refuses his help. She later runs into Aki, who compares himself to her a bit, in that they both rejected in the village. The next day, someone writes on the chalkboard that Chihaya committed adultery, which causes her to run away from the school, but returns after running into Aki again. Kyouhei chases after her, and ends up talking with Aki about her. Chihaya's reputation continues to deteriorate and she is once again approached by Atsushi, but Aki appears to protect her. She reveals to Aki that the writing on the chalkboard was true, and that she had indirectly caused the father's son to get hit by a car. Chihaya tells Aki that he reminds her of that boy and proceeds to kiss him. They then make love. She asks Aki to leave the village with her, but he refuses, saying that he has to regain Kuramitsuha.

Upon returning to the city, Kyohei suggests that they all go to the beach, which excite Utao. However, her expectations are shattered when they reach the beach only to find a typhoon. They find that their rooms are leaking water, so they come down to ask the owner of the inn about it while Utao bathes. However, as they are asking about it, a giant crash of lightning strikes and part of the inn falls down on the owner.

Utao, never having been to a legit library, gets curious and jumps at the chance to see it when she finds out that Hibino's father had forgotten to give her a book. While he's alone, Kyohei starts to think back about his quitting being a Seki, revealing that the true reason was that he feared he was like Aki and that he would do something similar if he snapped. At the library, Hibino runs into Aki, who notices that Kyohei has told her about Chihaya. Hibino asks Aki why he keeps going after Kyohei, to which Aki answers that he can see the darkness within Kyohei that no one else can.

Taking another step away from the action, Hirashiro explains to Aki that he is trying to bring the Kakashi out into the light to benefit people outside of the village. However, the elders would never approve of that, so he needs to get rid of them, and for that, he freed Aki. He asks Aki to join him, but at that moment, Mahiru bursts into the office, spewing her hate for everyone. Aki starts to fight her, but Magatsuhi is able to get the barrier up right as Aki just misses her with his attack. However, Mahiru doesn't kill Aki because she doesn't want to upset Kyohei.
