    "SummaryEnglish": "While testing out his camera on a bridge one summer night, Kaito sees a blue light streaking across the sky, only to be blown off the railing seconds later. Just before succumbing to unconsciousness, a hand reaches down to grab ahold of his own. He woke up the next morning wondering how he ended up back in his own room with no injuries or any recollection of the night before. As he proceeds with his normal school life, Kaito and his friends discuss what to do with his camera, finally deciding to make a film with it over the summer break. Noticing that Kaito has an interest in the new upperclassmen Ichika Takatsuki, his friend Tetsurou decides to invite her, as well as her friend Remon Yamano, to join them in their project.\r\nIn what becomes one of the most entertaining and exciting summers of their lives, Kaito and his friends find that their time spent together is not just about creating a film, but something much more meaningful that will force them to confront their true feelings.",

Listening to her story, Nanami lets her move in with them, since she will be away for quite some time, and she was looking for someone to take care of Kaito. Kanna was surprised to hear it, even thinking it to be some sort of a wedding arrangement in exasperation. After seeing Nanami off the next day, and right after shopping for clothes for Ichika, Kaito finds Lemon, Tetsurō, Mio and Kanna inside the house--to talk about the movie project.",

Kanna had to leave Kaito when she finds out Lemon has been filming their \"date.\" It so happened that Ichika crosses paths with Kaito. Nervous of the prospect that she wants to talk to him, he runs away from her, and a chase ensues.

Worried about what will happen next, Ichika enters and tries to take him home...though not without clashing a bit with Manami, acting like an overprotective lover, until Tetsurō comes to clear things up, that Manami is already married, and she's here because of a petty quarrel with her husband. As an apology Ichika asked Kaito for a favor from him. He asked if she could help him review for the finals, to which she agreed, and helped him study until the final day of exams.",

Even with the help of Rinna, one of Ichika's machines, Kaito dies rescuing \"the one he loves.\" Ichika, however, manages to reverse Kaito's death. Kaito awakens and sees himself with Ichika inside a ball of light, and mysteriously returning to the same spot.

This irritated Kanna, telling Ichika that \"looking for that place\" is just an excuse to avoid him. Kanna confessed that she has feelings for Kaito, and runs away after confronting Ichika--only to be consoled later by Tetsurō, hurting Mio in the process. Kaito, with a bit of encouragement from Lemon, did confess to Ichika later--and, when Kaito said it's his first kiss, she revealed that she has kissed Kaito four times already, as she gave him the fifth one.",
