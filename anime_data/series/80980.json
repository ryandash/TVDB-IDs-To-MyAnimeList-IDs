        "eng": "The story is based around 11-year-old Saga Bergmann, a young girl in a small German town who lives with her grandmother Regina and works in a coffee shop when not in school. Saga is extremely structured and plans her life down to the minute. One day, she notices a tiny creature in a fluffy outfit that appears to be starving. She offers it a waffle, which helps revive the tiny creature. Saga learns that this tiny creature is Sugar, an apprentice season fairy. Sugar explains that season fairies alter the weather by playing a magical musical instrument, and her specialty is snow, which she creates by playing the piccolo. Sugar is joined by two more apprentice season fairies, Salt, an outgoing male fairy who plays the trumpet to make the sun shine more brightly, and Pepper, a quiet and caring female fairy who plays the harp to make the wind blow.",
        "jpn": "架空の街・ミューレンブルク（ドイツのローテンブルクをモデルにしている）に住むサガという人間の少女が、妖精の世界から人間界に修業のためにやってきたシュガーという季節使いと出会い、生活を共にしつつ心の交流を育み、成長していくという物語である。また、サガとシュガーだけでなく、多くの登場人物も相互に影響しあって物語を形作っている。なお、季節使い達の成長は\"「きらめき」と呼ばれる何か\"という形をとって象徴的に描かれており、同時にこの「きらめき」をたくさん見つけることが彼らの修業の目的であるという設定となっている。"
