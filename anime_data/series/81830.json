After some trouble changing (no changing rooms and Nozomu having a rather unusual swimsuit) and an attempt at sunbathing, they discover a beach house nearby which is run by none other than Chizuru's mother Tamamo, and Yukihana. Tamamo once again tries to win Kouta's affections, much to Chizuru's frustration. Back at the beach, the group enjoys themselves with a barbecue and fireworks, but Chizuru is bothered because she cannot be alone with Kouta. Akane gets into trouble when she drifts too far offshore and is rescued by Tayura, making her warm up a little to him. Chizuru asks Kouta to take a walk with her on the beach under the stars, and eventually asks him how he feels about her.",

Kouta admits that he loves Chizuru in the end when he spots her crying in the rain on the bridge where they first met. Kouta and Chizuru become lovers, and Nozomu barges in saying that she accepts their relationship, and that she in turn will be Kouta's mistress, a thing which to Kouta's dismay Chizuru accepts.",
