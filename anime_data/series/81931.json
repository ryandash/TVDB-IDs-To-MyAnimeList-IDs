    "TitleEnglish": "Cyber City Oedo 808",
    "SummaryEnglish": "In the year 2808, three criminals are offered a stark choice: spend the rest of their lives aboard a maximum-security orbital prison, or return to Earth as agents of the Cyber Police. Parole violations will be rare as each criminal is fitted with a booby trapped, high explosive collar which operates on a 24 hour timer. If ever a check-in is missed, the consequences would be gruesome. For every criminal caught, the agents receive a bounty that reduces their total sentence, so some day they may walk free again.",

The most recent victim, Ichiro Edajima, used his own blood to scrawl a cryptic message on the wall and left notes to a very unusual retro-virus on his computer. The trail points to the top of the space elevator, and the cryogenic suspension facility tethered there. But the frozen death of cryogenic sleep may not have any meaning for one of the undead... and vampires can be hungry when they wake up!",
