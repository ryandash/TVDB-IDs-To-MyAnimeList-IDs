Nobunaga instructs Sasuke to offer Hisahide a pardon for the betrayal in exchange for the Hiragumo teakettle, a highly-prized and artistic piece. October, 1577 is the date of the siege. On the day of the negotiations, Hisahide refuses to surrender, instead filling the teakettle with gunpowder and strapping it to his chest. After the kettle explodes, Sasuke manages to preserve the top of it. In 1578, the first of Nobunaga's immense sea vessels are completed, known as the Great Atakabune, and it is set on display in the harbor. A merchant disparages Nobunaga for spending so much on the fleet, and Nobunaga, overhearing, kills him, not for the disparagement, but for not sticking to his opinion.

At home, Sasuke meets with his brother-in-law, Nakagawa Kiyohide, before his brother-in-law departs for war under his lord Araki Murashige.
