Unfortunately, there are also espers that abuse their powers and wield them to destructive ends. The Japanese government's solution of choice to both challenges is the establishment of the Base of Backing ESP Laboratory (B.A.B.E.L.) for the purpose of appraising, identifying, nurturing, and protecting espers (even if that means apprehending them as if they were criminals). Five decades later, B.A.B.E.L. locates a trio of natural Level 7 (the maximum esper potency designation) espers within Japan and assembles them into the special esper team known as \"The Children.\"",

During this time, one of the guards helps some of the esper criminals to escape—a mere diversion to allow a single prisoner (the actual ringleader) to get away. In her excitement during the battle, Kaoru tries to overpower the prisoner with a telekinetic blast that ends up breaching a reinforced outer wall and making it easier for the prisoner to rendezvous with a submarine. Kyōsuke appears before Kaoru to guide her through focusing her powers. With the submarine destroyed and the ringleader, along with the other fugitives, subdued, there is little comfort when Kyōsuke's instruction proves overwhelming for Kaoru whose powers soon go out of control.

Unfortunately, Shiho and Aoi being invited into a weekend outing prompts an anxious and overprotective Taizō to engage in research on Shiho and Aoi's infatuated suitors and to expect the worst of them as he orders illegal surveillance established. Finding that they have left early in the morning for their euphoric diurnal engagements, Kaoru reminisces back five years ago when she met Shiho and Aoi after arriving at B.A.B.E.L. and sets to spying on her teammates frightened of her special esper team disbanding. Minamoto finds Kaoru sulking and decides to engage her in a one-on-one euphoric diurnal engagement.

After the sentiment of him having dubious ethics subsides for the moment, Ichirō shows some recent photographs that show Naomi confronting a boy and of her shoplifting. Despite the feeling of deja vu, Kaoru, Shiho and Aoi realize that Ichirō is sincerely worried about Naomi; at Minamoto's behest, Akira begins the investigation by metempsychotically possessing a hamster and searching through the Kuretake B.A.B.E.L. Girls' Dormitory to find Naomi's room—the journey thereof being quite an adventure. Minamoto and Sakaki continue to watch Naomi conduct herself through a normal school day to find nothing of interest until Naomi (after dressing the part) sets course toward a biker bar to ask the gang there about a rash of robberies vectored at junior high students that have taken place in their neighborhood. During her explanation, the photographs that Ichirō recently took are of Naomi confronting a boy (who had sold some stolen property and given the revenue to the gang) and then secretly returning the stolen item.

Unfortunately, Momotarō loses his balance and unwisely tries to save the seeds—the penalty of which is induction into the slipstream of a passing truck and being electrocuted. Several hours later, Kaoru discovers the unconscious Momotarō during the return trip home from school and immediately decides to nurse him back to health at home—a decision that Shiho and Aoi are not entirely thrilled with. During his metempsychotic possession of a bird, Akira spotting an abandoned laboratory in the forest prompts Minamoto to call a recess and investigate. Meanwhile, after Kaoru cautiously attempts to feed Momotarō (who snaps awake to angrily chomp her finger not understanding her intentions), Shiho psychometrically discovers that Momotarō has no memory. Kashiwagi's arrival to keep an eye on the girls complicates things with the prospect of Momotarō's dysphoric discovery. Another psychotic episode of Momotarō acting out prompts Minamoto to explain that residential coexistence with Momotarō is impossible because of the wartime experimentation done on him. As if to prove Minamoto's situational ethics correct, Momotarō recovering himself to again jump to conclusions ignites another battle. After objecting to Minamoto chasing after Momotarō on the grounds that he is what she along with Shiho and Aoi once were—a maltreated creature whose life is of the same priceless value that theirs are, Kaoru leads her teammates after Hatsune and convince her to stand down before confronting Momotarō.

Kashiwagi sternly reprimands Kaoru for her criminal voyeurism before approaching Minamoto for help in illuminating the voyeur.

After a week of accompanying Dr. Sakaki on his nocturnal playboy adventures, Minamoto finds no sign of impending treachery—nor an avenue for proving it. Frustrated at their leader's obfuscation to their legitimate inquiries, Shiho tries using her psychometry but is foiled by an active device that guards against telepathy and psychometry. As the girls summon Naomi as well as Natsuko and Hotaru to act as a deus ex machina, Kugutsu even gets into the act by creating a life-size doll of Minamoto to throw off the girls—who are neither deceived or amused at the mirage as they rush out after their leader. The girls' first stop is at B.A.B.E.L.

Sakaki's arrival prompts a battle with Mio's assistant whose fighting becomes fiercer as his background and Mio's back story inspiring the advent of P.A.N.D.R.A. are revealed. Kaoru confronting Minamoto's affection for Mio (who is wearing a new outfit that Minamoto gave her) instigates another battle that Mio begins by creating two other clones whose merits and demerits are clearly demonstrated -- Aoi having trouble with her Mio clone and Shiho trapping hers using an old construction machine.

After being conscripted into water-skiing with his esper charges, Taizou explains to Minamoto that this precognitor's predictions are never wrong —- and hence can never be prevented. Much to everybody's surprise, the level 7 precognitor is a manufactured wartime esper -- much like Momotarou. After explaining the circumstances of his death in a resigned cavalier manner, the precognitor Lieutenant Ikyuugo states a prediction solely for Minamoto to be prevented at all costs -- a mortal confrontation with an adult Kaoru in battle in the ruins of a war-time city. Minamoto reassuring/comforting Kaoru quickly gives way to The Normal People anti-esper organization attacking the island with mortal designs for Taizou apparently having planned/rehearsed in advance.

Prior to mission zero hour, the quarry sibling electromagnetic espers introducing themselves with an electrical charge that incapacitates their helicopter and an electromagnetic eidolon pre-empts Minamoto's explanation of Kyousuke's ultimate goal being an esper-led war against humans. As Taizou frenzily works the main nerve center to locate them, Kaoru is loving the attention not realizing that she is playing right into the hands of the perpetrators who decide that it is necessary to have footage of Kaoru and her teammates attacking the city and its human citizens to ruin the image of espers in general.

A ping-pong match of insults/errant comments/seduction and Kaoru's telekinetic shoving defines the conclusion of Fujiko's estivation after Shiho's psychometry reads Fujiko's involuntary energy siphoning as voluntary seduction/copulation.

Fujiko phases in to begin appraising both The Children and Naomi before mentioning Minamoto's impending arrival. After seeing Naomi beating up on Ichirou, it becomes apparent that Fujiko wants Kaoru and her teammates to help her teach Minamoto what it takes to change fate. Unfortunately, the only change to fate that Fujiko's cruel prank successfully effects is Minamoto angrily resigning from B.A.B.E.L. in disgust of his feelings being trivialized and manipulated so friviously by his esper charges.",

Fortunately, Taizou sees the light as he explains that Fujiko is training Minamoto to increase his power. As Oboro mirrors the girls' confusion regarding Taizou's inadequate explanation, Fujiko is directing the hypnotic nurse Hanae Suetsu to take good care of Minamoto. Minamoto's disgust and Hanae's anguish give way to Fujiko again warning Minamoto that he will see his esper charges as adults unless he makes some drastic changes. Fujiko is realizing some meager success from her plan as Hanae successfully emulates both Shiho and Aoi as adults; aside from Fujiko rushing things a little, not a whole lot could go wrong . . . except the real Aoi who is not at all flattered by the emulation and Kaoru who sees Fujiko as her vendetta. After driving home his passionate displeasure of Fujiko and Hanae's conduct of him as a plaything, Minamoto apologizes about the resignation threat and realizes that the avenue to save his esper charges' future and keep them away from P.A.N.D.R.A. is to make lots and lots of euphoric memories with them in the present",

As he watches a mosquito fly around to land on Kaoru and then on Aoi, Minamoto realizes that the contamination is not why the workers are unconscious while he recovers himself from crashing into the wall. Shiho psychometrically confirming what Minamoto already knows and explaining the whole situation at hand quickly yields to Minamoto having been taken over by thousands of mosquitoes much to the delight of Kyousuke and Momotarou. Frightened for his gonads, Kyousuke advises that incapacitating the mosquito psychometer and exterminating the mosquitoes should resolve the situation -- a task Kaoru finds easier said than done since her telekinesis repels them right against the glass windows containing the whole pestilence. The deux es machina comes when Kaoru is advised to subjugate the mosquitoes by telekinetically moving the air around and instigating the fire extinguishers. The mosquitoes drowning in the water from the fire extinguishers (and Shiho adding washing detergent to accelerate their demise), the mosquito psychometer trapped in a vice, the emergency responders doing their thing down below, and Minamoto's factual *destination perdition* counterargument . . . none of that convinces Kyousuke to soften his heart toward human-esper peaceful coexistence.",

While B.A.B.E.L. works feverishly to locate Minamoto and Carry, Dr. Sakaki explains the prologue thereof. Unfortunately, because of the incomplete rehabilitation whose greatest symptom is Minamoto's abduction at Carry's hands, Comerica seems to have decided extermination for Caroline so that it can continue the experiment that spawned the advent of Carry. Kyousuke amusedly observing the confrontation set aside for the moment, things get even more complicated when Aoi and her teammates phase in demanding an explanation for the situation. Frightened by the aggregate agitated ambiance, Carrie immobilizes everybody with an acoustic shockwave before phasing out with Minamoto. Anguished at not being able to save her leader and frustrated that she is being kept out of the loop, Kaoru prepares to discharge an energy blast . . . and would have if not for Fujiko phasing in with the revelation of neutrality for B.A.B.E.L. in this matter. After Colonel Grisham phases out with both Ken and Mary, Fujiko detains Kaoru and her teammates (who are not dispassionate actors) as she explains that their sentimental interference will complicate the whole operation and will be treated as aiding/abetting a fugitive.",

The political and sentimental frenzy obfuscates Minamoto's computation of the fundamental ethical dilemma: while his esper charges are important and their development is his primary responsibility, Comerica sees Carrie as nothing more than a scientific mistake to be erased. Furthermore, setting aside Comerica for Japan, Kyousuke is always on the prowl for more espers to wield as soldiers -- Carrie being his quintessence volition because she knows no better. Carrie brushes aside Minamoto's explanation attempts before conscripting him into a whirlwind tour all over Japan not caring about the circumstances. While he fails in coercing induction into P.A.N.D.R.A. as the price for his intercession against the Comerican agents, Kyousuke does give B.A.B.E.L. the perfect excuse to abandon the unethical neutrality and come to Minamoto's aid. Appalled at everybody fighting over her, Carrie cries out an anguished entreaty for her euphoric memories. Kyousuke's departure, Dr. Sakaki leading Kaoru and her teammates in sweeping away the Comerican agents, and Fujiko arm-twisting a comprehensive withdrawal of the Comerican president makes Carrie realize that she needs to resolve her unfinished business quickly.

Fortunately, in spite of basically waylaying him, Kaoru and her teammates quickly befriend Takashi as they demonstrate their respective powers and explain that ESP is nothing bad or shameful. There is little that can go awry as Takashi is in seventh heaven with Kaoru and her teammates warmly accepting him as is . . . except for the sudden arrival of Takashi's father Tekeno who has written his antipathy for espers into a book. His psychic powers now active in earnest, Takashi rushes off to settle the score with a bully. Once Aoi successfully locates him, it is a simple matter to phase in upon Takashi with an austere reproof and an emphatic injunction against abusing and misusing his powers. What drives this lesson home, however, is a terrorist attack by The Normal People who show their anger at Aoi frenzily teleporting the people to safety by driving several tanker trucks loaded with fuel into the congregation. The deus ex machina consists of the triple punch of Minamoto confronting Tekeno at the news station, Takashi psychokinetically immobilizing the bridge while Aoi phases out the casualties and Kaoru sweeps the bridge clear, and Dr. Sakaki wielding a squad of B.A.B.E.L. agents to confront the masterminds. The euphoric epilogue is enhanced even more when Tekeno sees the light and demonstrates that the love for his son is greater than his ignorance regarding espers having realized that it is the virtue or vice within the heart that determines whether ESP is wielded constructively or destructively.",
