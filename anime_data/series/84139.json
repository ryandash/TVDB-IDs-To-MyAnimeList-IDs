Unfortunately, there are also espers that abuse their powers and wield them to destructive ends. The Japanese government's solution of choice to both challenges is the establishment of the Base of Backing ESP Laboratory (B.A.B.E.L.) for the purpose of appraising, identifying, nurturing, and protecting espers (even if that means apprehending them as if they were criminals). Five decades later, B.A.B.E.L. locates a trio of natural Level 7 (the maximum esper potency designation) espers within Japan and assembles them into the special esper team known as \"The Children.\"",

During this time, one of the guards helps some of the esper criminals to escape—a mere diversion to allow a single prisoner (the actual ringleader) to get away. In her excitement during the battle, Kaoru tries to overpower the prisoner with a telekinetic blast that ends up breaching a reinforced outer wall and making it easier for the prisoner to rendezvous with a submarine. Kyōsuke appears before Kaoru to guide her through focusing her powers. With the submarine destroyed and the ringleader, along with the other fugitives, subdued, there is little comfort when Kyōsuke's instruction proves overwhelming for Kaoru whose powers soon go out of control.

The National Police Agency director arrives with the perspective that age is not an excuse against a citizen being obligated to assist in criminal investigations. The revelation that Shiho is the daughter of the Director marginalized for the moment to subside, Minamoto quickly departs with Shiho after making it clear that there better be a logical rationale for ordering Shiho's psychometry wielded in policework before he cooperates. Not being able to see anything insightful with her psychometry during Detective Uchida's initial tour through Maked Justice's journey, Shiho eventually reasons that Masked Justice actively hunts for quarry to attack without warning rather than randomly encountering it. Shiho successfully identifying the perpetrator does her little good as she is suddenly abducted after being isolated from her teammates. The abduction foiled with a couple of telekinetic shoves from Kaoru and a dropped object on Aoi's part, Uchida's attack is foiled by the Director's timely intervention. During the car ride home, Shiho assures Minamoto that she is accustomed to there being a dysphoric face to the world because he protects her right alongside Kaoru and Aoi.",

Grisham prompts him to summon B.A.B.E.L. with the exhortation to apprehend the Comerican renegade. Sakaki sets off by car while the Wild Cat and Doubleface teams set off by helicopter to pique the Colonel's interest and instigate something for the B.A.B.E.L. Precognition Department to detect. Even after all she has seen and endured with Kaoru, Mary still cannot believe that Kaoru is a Level 7 telekinetic. The rivalry is set aside for the moment when the Colonel is detected at a dam. En route to the scene, Minamoto explains that the objective is to illuminate and apprehend all the defectors (the Colonel as well as the adversary agents) while Kyōsuke sees this event as entertainment and heads out to watch. After several hours of waiting, Shiho decides to approach the Colonel to discern his intention only to find that the Colonel's Level 7 telepathy affords the ability to wield any nearby esper powers to his advantage and has earned him the title Esper Killer. After the Colonel evacuates from the battle scene (probably by using Aoi's teleportation), Ken detects an abandoned cell phone and Mary telekinetically retrieves it. Shiho's psychometric inspection of the phone reveals that the Colonel's plans to head to a dam at a certain time the next day, basically inviting B.A.B.E.L. and Liberty Bell to come witness the event and challenge him there.",

Kaoru and Mary's rivalry flaring up again is only extinguished by Ken's cacophonous recital of Colonel Grisham's back story of his recuperation expedited by no small margin at the hands of a young Japanese girl named Saya, prompting Minamoto to investigate the epilogue. The decision to only use telekinesis in the ensuing confrontation is complicated by the Colonel having telepathically predicted the assault and wielding the telekinesis to double the detrimental effect. Angered about the Colonel's mammary depiction, Kaoru and Mary's combined telekinesis starts to drain away the reservoir to reveal an abandoned city. As Naomi accelerates the process with her telekinesis, Minamoto explains that Colonel Grisham's defection is a mirage driven by his desire to have both Japan and Comerica drain away the reservoir so that the terminally-ill Saya (who he had Aoi and Shiho transport to the scene) could see her birthplace one final time. After they take a short respite to recover themselves, Kaoru, Mary, and Naomi rally their combined telekinesis behind the Colonel to finally drain the reservoir and set the water aside. Recalling his role in Colonel Grisham's current status, Kyōsuke even decides to lend his hypnotic assistance to cast Saya as the young girl with her house as it was 60 years ago and smooth out the political aftermath with the Comerican government.",

Unfortunately, Momotarō loses his balance and unwisely tries to save the seeds—the penalty of which is induction into the slipstream of a passing truck and being electrocuted. Several hours later, Kaoru discovers the unconscious Momotarō during the return trip home from school and immediately decides to nurse him back to health at home—a decision that Shiho and Aoi are not entirely thrilled with.

Kashiwagi's arrival to keep an eye on the girls complicates things with the prospect of Momotarō's dysphoric discovery. Another psychotic episode of Momotarō acting out prompts Minamoto to explain that residential coexistence with Momotarō is impossible because of the wartime experimentation done on him. As if to prove Minamoto's situational ethics correct, Momotarō recovering himself to again jump to conclusions ignites another battle. After objecting to Minamoto chasing after Momotarō on the grounds that he is what she along with Shiho and Aoi once were—a maltreated creature whose life is of the same priceless value that theirs are, Kaoru leads her teammates after Hatsune and convince her to stand down before confronting Momotarō.

After a week of accompanying Dr. Sakaki on his nocturnal playboy adventures, Minamoto finds no sign of impending treachery—nor an avenue for proving it. Frustrated at their leader's obfuscation to their legitimate inquiries, Shiho tries using her psychometry but is foiled by an active device that guards against telepathy and psychometry. As the girls summon Naomi as well as Natsuko and Hotaru to act as a deus ex machina, Kugutsu even gets into the act by creating a life-size doll of Minamoto to throw off the girls—who are neither deceived or amused at the mirage as they rush out after their leader.

After a brief history lesson, Taizou concludes that not much can be accomplished and is about to lead Oboro and Minamoto away when Aoi and her teammates phase in from a teleportation jump eager to find out what their leader is doing. A ping-pong match of insults/errant comments/seduction and Kaoru's telekinetic shoving defines the conclusion of Fujiko's estivation after Shiho's psychometry reads Fujiko's involuntary energy siphoning as voluntary seduction/copulation. After an introductory kiss to Kaoru/Shiho/Aoi (much to their watery/soapy disgust) along with the just-arrived Naomi, Fujiko sets to bringing herself up to speed at B.A.B.E.L. and yearns to spend more girl time with Double Face before approaching Minamoto to explain that his esper charges are going to turn out exactly what Kyousuke wants if they stay under his leadership in its incumbent state. As Minamoto is sent off to another location to be detained, Ichirou leads Naomi and The Children on another exercise -- this time, a tanker with a leaky fuel tank that will explode in 30 minutes. Fujiko phases in to begin appraising both The Children and Naomi before mentioning Minamoto's impending arrival. After seeing Naomi beating up on Ichirou, it becomes apparent that Fujiko wants Kaoru and her teammates to help her teach Minamoto what it takes to change fate. Unfortunately, the only change to fate that Fujiko's cruel prank successfully effects is Minamoto angrily resigning from B.A.B.E.L. in disgust of his feelings being trivialized and manipulated so friviously by his esper charges.",

After successfully pacifying the girls before they completely destroy B.A.B.E.L. Headquarters with such ease that it could be argued that the tempest was by her design, Fujiko resolves to make Minamoto recant the resignation declaration as she spirits him away into a brief history lesson and personal anecdote. While Fujiko illuminates her awareness of Ikyuugo's final prediction for Minamoto through her admonition to guard against being such a workaholic and to spend quality time with his esper charges, Kaoru and her teammates are not thrilled about Taizou and Oboro paying them a visit. Fortunately, Taizou sees the light as he explains that Fujiko is training Minamoto to increase his power. As Oboro mirrors the girls' confusion regarding Taizou's inadequate explanation, Fujiko is directing the hypnotic nurse Hanae Suetsu to take good care of Minamoto. Minamoto's disgust and Hanae's anguish give way to Fujiko again warning Minamoto that he will see his esper charges as adults unless he makes some drastic changes. Fujiko is realizing some meager success from her plan as Hanae successfully emulates both Shiho and Aoi as adults; aside from Fujiko rushing things a little, not a whole lot could go wrong . . . except the real Aoi who is not at all flattered by the emulation and Kaoru who sees Fujiko as her vendetta. After driving home his passionate displeasure of Fujiko and Hanae's conduct of him as a plaything, Minamoto apologizes about the resignation threat and realizes that the avenue to save his esper charges' future and keep them away from P.A.N.D.R.A. is to make lots and lots of euphoric memories with them in the present",

In an attempt to resolve the undecided 45%, Minamoto presents his esper charges with new portal limiters that serve as communicators/transponders like their predecessors and boast a function that enables any of the girls to rally their teammates' powers to enhance their own. Kaoru, Shiho, and Aoi playing with all the treasures in the bank vault using their psychic powers is brought to a screeching halt when Minamoto reminds them that they are charged sentry duty thereof and that there are ECM generators lining the ceiling of the vault. Muscle and Mio's arrival instigates a battle with Kaoru (a psychokinetic gold ingot barrage), Aoi (teleporting away the ECCM generator), and Shiho (a well-aimed bullet to the generator's battery) that easily stalemates the two P.A.N.D.R.A. espers but places them before The Normal People operatives' mortal designs as they close the vault and exhaust out the air. Their lives in jeopardy, an uneasy armistice is forged as Minamoto works to repair the damaged ECCM generator before directing Kaoru to psychokinetically breach the inner walls of the vault along with the electromagnetic fence once Shiho, Aoi, and Mio all rally their powers behind her. Unfortunately, a thoroughly-exhausted Kaoru and paper money/gold ingots/various treasures scattered about for the people to grab up quickly takes a back seat to Fujiko successfully cornering the evacuating Kyousuke into a one-on-one psychic duel that ends in a stalemate illuminating that P.A.N.D.R.A. does not conquer easily.",

Upon arriving in Kyoto, the warm greeting that Aoi's junior brother Yuuki quickly turning frigid and dangerous due to Aoi's father Daisaku misunderstanding Aoi's affectionate description of Minamoto gives way to Ken and Minamoto disagreeing on whether to solicit Aoi's navigation assistance for their mission: apprehension an esper vandal called Clyde Barou that sees historical landmarks as his personal canvas. Minamoto lashing out at Ken before turning his frustration on Aoi becomes a horrible mistake when Ken detects that Clyde is on the move. Fujiko and the Comerican esper squad being of no utility, it falls upon Minamoto and Ken to take action alongside Aoi. When Clyde turns the tables on her during the first battle, Minamoto gives Aoi a quick lesson in navigating around using her esper powers and reminds her that she has done well on her own in combat. Aoi challenges and successfully defeats Clyde as he is computing his next desecration.

After she gets over the euphoria of winning the race (and conking Dr. Sakaki on the head with a game controller), Kaoru's full-blown temper tantrum and accusation of Shiho of losing the race on purpose prompts Sakaki to advise Shiho to hold back a bit from commenting on what comes to mind. Shiho is about to riposite her perspective on Sakaki's advice when Kaoru suggests that Sakaki and Shiho race against each other, the duration thereof defined by lots of psychometric trash-talking -- and Sakaki losing to Shiho's concentration and his overconfidence. Shiho psychometrically teaching herself how to use the fishing pole to catch the quarry fish on the first try (to the astonishment of Sakaki who is a veteran angler) gives way to an encounter with Dr. Sakaki's old instructor from Touto University that teaches Shiho to turn her back on ignorance and morally be the bigger woman as Sakaki tends to the seasick Kaoru before seeing to the Professor who is bleeding internally from a ruptured spleen. As he operates on the Professor, Sakaki explains to Shiho (who is grossed out by all the blood/gore) that psychometric inspection is not the same as actual viewing before confessing that he is envious of Shiho's fortune. Sakaki tells Shiho that Minamoto is the one normal that could understand/celebrate him for the person he is and that she is lucky that she can be a kid thanks to having Minamoto to intercede for her when/how appropriate.

During the actual hiking trip, Kaoru and her teammates painting their leader Minamoto as a common relative of theirs prompts Chisato to recount that she has had euphoric company with Minamoto. Chisato's euphoric daydream example is quickly extinguished when a small pebble hits Kaoru who immediately accuses Touno of the offense in spite of the evidence indicating the inverse. Kaoru bragging about her homemade lunch ignites Touno's jealousy and a keep-away game whose aftermath is a scavenger hunt that nobody was prepared for. During a layover to wait out the rainstorm, Shiho and Aoi debate how to locate Kaoru (who is out of communication range) while Chisato jumps to conclusions from the limited data provided by her Level 2 telepathy. Kaoru and Touno's heart-to-heart to understand each other better quickly yields to the below-ground facility being elevated at-ground at Taizou's behest. Kaoru reunited with her teammates/classmates and her lost lunch has all the makings of a happy ending -- and would have been if Mio had not seized Kaoru's lunch away. P.A.N.D.R.A. seems to have learned of the below-ground facility that Taizou had built and has charged Mio, Muscle, and Momotarou the exploration and appraisal thereof. The resolution of some enigmas gives way to a comical keep-away game with Kaoru's lunch that ends in a B.A.B.E.L. victory due to Momotarou's inability to stay aloft with the mass of Kaoru's lunch.",

Once inside the building, the B.A.B.E.L. crew finds several unconscious workers with swelled bumps on their heads. As he watches a mosquito fly around to land on Kaoru and then on Aoi, Minamoto realizes that the contamination is not why the workers are unconscious while he recovers himself from crashing into the wall. Shiho psychometrically confirming what Minamoto already knows and explaining the whole situation at hand quickly yields to Minamoto having been taken over by thousands of mosquitoes much to the delight of Kyousuke and Momotarou. Frightened for his gonads, Kyousuke advises that incapacitating the mosquito psychometer and exterminating the mosquitoes should resolve the situation -- a task Kaoru finds easier said than done since her telekinesis repels them right against the glass windows containing the whole pestilence. The deux es machina comes when Kaoru is advised to subjugate the mosquitoes by telekinetically moving the air around and instigating the fire extinguishers. The mosquitoes drowning in the water from the fire extinguishers (and Shiho adding washing detergent to accelerate their demise), the mosquito psychometer trapped in a vice, the emergency responders doing their thing down below, and Minamoto's factual *destination perdition* counterargument . . . none of that convinces Kyousuke to soften his heart toward human-esper peaceful coexistence.",

Promptly seizing the wine bottle to extinguish Sakaki's explanation with an emphatic »Not another word!!!« cranial blow, Minamoto bellows an austere injunction against inebriation and interloping. While Kaoru has found seventh heaven with the broad and eclectic anthology of mammaries, Shiho decides to investigate the epilogue of Minamoto's earlier story and encounters what she thinks is an adversarial interloper who (after Minamoto computes all the factors) turns out to be Hanae with her hypnotic metamorphosis fully dormant. Minamoto explaining to Hanae that her conduct is more important than the construction of her visage prompts Kaoru, Shiho and Aoi to confront their leader frightened of a placid paramour displacing his paternal affection for them. Ultimately, the lesson is demonstrated is that a frenzied genius like Kouichi Minamoto converged upon into a corner is just as dangerous as 100 espers . . . especially with a remote-controlled drill tank.",

Upon arriving in Imapalahem, Badjura has Kaoru and her teammates very exquisitely customized so that they are as princesses. Minamoto's vapid apprisal quickly gives way to Masara introducing herself with an energy ring attack and Fujiko quickly extinguishing the battle. Prince Badjura's explanation of his country Impalahem being in many ways similar to B.A.B.E.L. and boasting as its greatest treasure a statue that houses the souls of deceased espers and priestesses explicitly illuminates his volition -- to emancipate his esper priestess paramour Sera from Masara's metempsychotic subjugation which will only be extinguished by nothing less than combat. With the aid of some specially made armaments and the metempsychotic energy perimeter, Kaoru and her teammates easily stalemate Masara's attacks. Between the combined volition of Kaoru and Badjura for destroying Sera's body and a desolate global wasteland in order to be victorious along with the souls of the espers and priestesses against continuing to aid her, Masara sees the light and capitulates. Though amused at the scene of the uxorial affection Kaoru and her teammates have for their leader, Masara's anxiety for the girls' future is mirrored in Kyousuke having second thoughts about his past conduct and realizing that the effects thereof are beyond his power to reverse.",

Unfortunately, the resultant »all systems go« does nothing to allay the concern shared by Minamoto and Dr. Sakaki that Kaoru's portal limiter will eventually be emasculated to nothing more than a fancy accessory with each successive incidence of the Triple Boost function being availed. The prospect of Kaoru emancipating herself from her portal limiter and falling to vice wanes in urgency as Shiho and Aoi are charged the apprehension of Black Phantom's recent acquisition Tim Toy alongside Naomi. In spite of Aoi successfully discerning the mechanics of his powers, she and Shiho prove to be no match for Tim Toy on their own. Naomi deftly dodging the robot's attacks and Fujiko's intercession hold the battle at a stalemate until Kaoru flies onto the scene to destroy the robot before flying Shiho and Aoi out of his aggression radius. Galvanized by the Triple Boost, Kaoru leads Shiho and Aoi through the delivery of a blistering reproof of Tim Toy's very destructive misconduct driven home with a collaborative flying kick. While Tim Toy is successfully emancipated from the Black Phantom subjugation, poor Minamoto is subjugated to replacing the destroyed fighter plane while the amused Kyousuke decides that he has seen enough for the time being.",

Headquarters to pay him a visit driven by her childish alternate personality Carry who is just as zero-sum regarding Minamoto as Kaoru and her teammates whom she knocks out with an acoustic shockwave before flying off with Minamoto in full view of Ken and Mary along with their leader Colonel Grisham who decide to give chase. While B.A.B.E.L. works feverishly to locate Minamoto and Carry, Dr. Sakaki explains the prologue thereof. Unfortunately, because of the incomplete rehabilitation whose greatest symptom is Minamoto's abduction at Carry's hands, Comerica seems to have decided extermination for Caroline so that it can continue the experiment that spawned the advent of Carry. Kyousuke amusedly observing the confrontation set aside for the moment, things get even more complicated when Aoi and her teammates phase in demanding an explanation for the situation. Frightened by the aggregate agitated ambiance, Carrie immobilizes everybody with an acoustic shockwave before phasing out with Minamoto. Anguished at not being able to save her leader and frustrated that she is being kept out of the loop, Kaoru prepares to discharge an energy blast . . . and would have if not for Fujiko phasing in with the revelation of neutrality for B.A.B.E.L. in this matter. After Colonel Grisham phases out with both Ken and Mary, Fujiko detains Kaoru and her teammates (who are not dispassionate actors) as she explains that their sentimental interference will complicate the whole operation and will be treated as aiding/abetting a fugitive.",

The political and sentimental frenzy obfuscates Minamoto's computation of the fundamental ethical dilemma: while his esper charges are important and their development is his primary responsibility, Comerica sees Carrie as nothing more than a scientific mistake to be erased. Furthermore, setting aside Comerica for Japan, Kyousuke is always on the prowl for more espers to wield as soldiers -- Carrie being his quintessence volition because she knows no better. Carrie brushes aside Minamoto's explanation attempts before conscripting him into a whirlwind tour all over Japan not caring about the circumstances. While he fails in coercing induction into P.A.N.D.R.A. as the price for his intercession against the Comerican agents, Kyousuke does give B.A.B.E.L. the perfect excuse to abandon the unethical neutrality and come to Minamoto's aid. Appalled at everybody fighting over her, Carrie cries out an anguished entreaty for her euphoric memories. Kyousuke's departure, Dr. Sakaki leading Kaoru and her teammates in sweeping away the Comerican agents, and Fujiko arm-twisting a comprehensive withdrawal of the Comerican president makes Carrie realize that she needs to resolve her unfinished business quickly. Carrie now in dormancy within Minamoto's heart with the promise of perpetual proximity, Caroline rockets off into space to realize her childhood dream.",

Minamoto summons the girls to charge them surveillance thereof. Fortunately, in spite of basically waylaying him, Kaoru and her teammates quickly befriend Takashi as they demonstrate their respective powers and explain that ESP is nothing bad or shameful. There is little that can go awry as Takashi is in seventh heaven with Kaoru and her teammates warmly accepting him as is . . . except for the sudden arrival of Takashi's father Tekeno who has written his antipathy for espers into a book. His psychic powers now active in earnest, Takashi rushes off to settle the score with a bully. Once Aoi successfully locates him, it is a simple matter to phase in upon Takashi with an austere reproof and an emphatic injunction against abusing and misusing his powers. What drives this lesson home, however, is a terrorist attack by The Normal People who show their anger at Aoi frenzily teleporting the people to safety by driving several tanker trucks loaded with fuel into the congregation. The deus ex machina consists of the triple punch of Minamoto confronting Tekeno at the news station, Takashi psychokinetically immobilizing the bridge while Aoi phases out the casualties and Kaoru sweeps the bridge clear, and Dr. Sakaki wielding a squad of B.A.B.E.L. agents to confront the masterminds. The euphoric epilogue is enhanced even more when Tekeno sees the light and demonstrates that the love for his son is greater than his ignorance regarding espers having realized that it is the virtue or vice within the heart that determines whether ESP is wielded constructively or destructively.",

Fujiko phasing out after an admonition for rigorous vigilance for Tim and Barrett yields to old Obata charging Hanae an important stewardship: a notebook endowed with the psychic power of serendipity. Unfortunately, Obata has two notebooks -- one of which Kyousuke discovered. Hypnotically emulating Minamoto, Kyousuke pollutes the B.A.B.E.L. database and decides to amuse himself by wielding Obata's notebook to compromise the cohesiveness Kaoru and her teammates enjoy. The ensuing series of game theory exhibitions promptly demonstrates that Kaoru, Shiho, and Aoi (along with the adult B.A.B.E.L. personnel) will turn on each other like sharks in a blood-crazed feeding frenzy without Kyousuke's external assistance.

The altercation that ensues is only interrupted when a music box floats onto the scene -- an anniversary gift to the trio from Minamoto symbolizing the good times they once shared. In the present, Kaoru and her teammates being disappointed that Minamoto has chosen to congratulate their promotion to fifth grade with a scaled-down pastry sets the stage for Kyousuke to summon the girls into a dormant amusement park to encourage them to have fun with their psychic powers. While making a meal of reheated food, Kyousuke explains his prologue of basically hating all normals because of his commanding officer's mortal attempt on his life. Incensed by his prejudice, Kaoru flies Kyousuke out of the apartment into a fierce battle that starts out as the latter mocking the former.
