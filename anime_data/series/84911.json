Enter Yusei Fudou, a young man who lives on the edge of the law, making his own rules. His desire to reclaim what is rightly his from an old friend turns into much more than what he and many of his newfound companions called \"Signers\" would have ever bargained for.",

Yusei's life points get reduced to 1 too, before he summons his Stardust Dragon and takes advantage of the traps Crow and Jack placed beforehand. As Yusei tries to reach Goodwin, which he successfully does, he regains the Signers' marks from him. Furthermore, Yusei gains Roman's mark of the Dragon Head, and the mark of the Tail that Yusei used to have transfers over to Crow.\r\nYusei then takes the marks of the other 4 Signers, and gains the Seal of the Crimson Dragon. Then, he summons the Majestic Star Dragon and destroys Earthbound Immortal Wiraqocha Rasca, which defeats Goodwin. Then, the Crimson Dragon envelops the Majestic Star Dragon, infusing it with the power of the Crimson Dragon, and dives into the King of the Netherworld. Yusei then sees a vision where he and the Goodwin brothers are inside the King of the Netherworld, and he sees all of the Dark Signers lying unconscious, floating in mid-air. The moment before the King of the Netherworld is destroyed, Rex Goodwin tells Yusei that he was successful in reaching him, and tells him to take care of the other Dark Signers, as they will be sent back to Earth. The Goodwin brothers decide to sacrifice themselves, so that the other Dark Signers can be revived. The King of the Netherworld explodes, the Altar of the Dragon Star (Rex Goodwin's dueling platform) is dissolved, and the Geoglyph duel tracks disappear, which causes Jack and Crow to fall. However, the Crimson Dragon catches both of them, and repairs all of the damage done by the King of the Netherworld.

Whilst investigating it, Lazar encounters three people from Yliaster, who are Jakob (the leader), Lester (self-appointed sub-leader), and Primo (the lowest-ranking member). Lazar questions them about their intentions, but after being reminded by Primo that they were his leaders, and a brief outburst in which Primo points the tip of his sword at Lazar's neck, he quickly submits to the trio, and turns over the leadership of New Domino City to them. Then, Primo tells the other members of the trio that he was going to take his Machine Emperor out for a \"test drive.\" A day later, Sector Security investigates a turbo duelist named Ghost, who is attacking Turbo Duelists, and \"stealing\" their Synchro Monsters, at night. Jack, Yusei and Crow, meanwhile, are preparing for an upcoming tournament, the World Racing Grand Prix (WRGP), but when Trudge suggests Jack, Crow, and Yusei to help him take down the Ghost, Crow rejects Trudge's plea for assistance, in favor of working on their new engine, as he states that they have the Grand Prix to prepare for, and that they don't have any time to spare. Instead, Crow insists that Trudge and the rest of Sector Security, being the cops, go chase after the Ghost themselves. Trudge encounters Ghost later that night, but is defeated and severely injured. He warns Yusei not to use Synchro Monsters against Ghost, as \"Synchros are useless.\" After the incident, Crow feels guilty about what he told Trudge. After Yusei tells him that blaming himself was not going to work, Crow asks Yusei what he should do, to which Yusei replies that they go find and beat the Ghost. Yusei, Jack and Crow then go and search for Ghost, who Yusei soon encounters after several hours of riding. He soon finds himself up against Ghost's ace monster, Machine Empero",

The Ghost then crashes into a forest, and one of the 3 emperors of Yliaster, Primo, retrieves Ghost's duel disk, and his own Wisel deck from The Ghost's duel runner. When Yusei, Jack and Crow arrive at The Ghost's crash site, they discover he is actually a robot that Trudge identifies as a Duel-Bot, that was stolen from Sector Security, and reprogrammed.",

Finding a fingerprint on a cup ramen packet, they decide to hack into the Security network to find the culprit, having to complete a puzzle duel in order to gain access.

Jakob then activates a trap, which brings out Grannel Attack 3, while reducing Yusei's life points to 2,800. Jakob shows Yusei and the others a twisted future where New Domino City is completely destroyed. Due to Synchro Monsters and Ener-D evolving the world at an incredible rate, a war broke out and the Ener-D reactor eventually exploded, destroying most of the world. The Yliaster trio also unveil their memmories of despair. In the future, they see everybody Synchro Summoning, and as a result of them using Synchro Monsters to achieve their own greedy desires, the Machine Emperors show up one day, and begin killing humans. In the vision, as Lester was running with his parents to safety, a Grannel shot his parents down. Lester in the vision, then wails at the death of his parents, the ones who loved him. Then, Primo reveals that he joined the Freedom Fighters, a group of military people who destroy Machine Emperors, to restore freedom to mankind. He also reveals that he fell in love with one of their number, and they often fought together. When they ambush another Grannel, it retaliates, by shooting down the building, killing his girlfriend in the process. Primo then cries over her death, and when the Grannel comes to kill him, he angrily shoots it down. Jakob then reveals that he was the \"last survivor\" of the Machine Emperor attack. He then says that he tried for years to find other humans, but to no avail. In the future, Jakob then sheds some tears over the destruction of humankind. Back in the duel, although the Yliaster trio said that the events the Signers just saw were their memories of humanity's destruction, Yusei refuses to believe that any of it was true. Yusei then brings out Shooting Star Dragon, and manages to destroy Machine Emperor Grannel Infinity, which reduces Jakob's life points from 12,000 down to 3,900. Just then, Jakob",

Aporia then activates the continuous trap card, Infinite Prison, so that by sending the trap, Infinity Force from his hand to the Graveyard, he can treat Grand Core as a spell card from the graveyard, and then set it face-down in the face-down zone. He then destroys Infinite Prison in order to add Sky Core, Wise Core, and Grand Core to his hand, which had been set face-down. Next, Aporia sends the 3 Machine Emperor Cores to the graveyard, in order to activate the trap card: Genesis of the Machine Emperors, which allows him to special summons his ace monster, Machine Divine Emperor Mechanicle Infinity Cubic. Then, he causes his Machine Divine Emperor to shoot energy into the sky, which results in lightning striking all over New Domino City. Aporia also manages to have his Machine Divine Emperor absorb Shooting Star Dragon, which increases Mechanicle's attack points from 4,000 to 7,300. Aporia then shows more visions of the future, in which he, in the human form of Jakob, is one of the last 4 survivors of a global Ener-D explosion, and an attack by Machine Emperors and Synchro Monsters on Earth, is approached by Z-ONE (his actual name is Yliadus), Paradox, and Bruno in his Vizor adult form, who are the last human survivors on Earth, who agree to try to prevent the disasters from occurring.

He also questions Z-ONE about why he erased Antinomy's memories, theorising that he wanted Team 5D's to evolve in order to change the future. Aporia also reveals that the Black Hole that Antinomy was trapped in was a part of the Ark Cradle, but somewhere in future space, and he asks Z-ONE if he was holding Antinomy hostage for some purpose for the future. Aporia then demands that he returns Antinomy to Yusei, and states that is the final task that Aporia will make Z-ONE accomplish, now that he has hope. Then, Z-ONE tells Aporia that the time for despair is near, and then he summons 2 huge mechanicle dueling arms, and giant deck, and turns his huge stone tablets, that were scattered all over the room into real, giant cards, whic",

However, on his next turn, Temporal Machine God Metaion returns to Z-ONE's deck, and he summons out another Temporal Machine God, Razion, using Zero Machine Ein's effect once more. Razion's effect returns all of Aporia's cards in his Graveyard back to his deck, which was then suffled. As a result, Aporia is unable to draw the card he needs (After Glow), and is defeated by Razion's effect, which deals him 1,000 points of damage when he draws a card on the draw phase. Before he dies, Aporia gives Yusei's Duel Runner wings, by fusing his duel disk with Yusei's duel runner, allowing it to fly. Yusei challenges Z-ONE to a final turbo duel taking place in the skies between New Domino City and Ark Cradle as the collision approaches, which will be broadcast across New Domino City, through the Ark Cradle. The Ark Cradle then glows Rainbow, the walls of the room then turns transparent, which gives the Signers an upside down view of New Domino City, and huge monitors appear around the Ark Cradle, which will be used for the broadcast.

Z-ONE then summons 3 more Temporal Machine God monsters through his trap's effect. He then attacks Yusei's Black-Winged Dragon with his Temporal Machine God Tzaphion, in an attempt to utilize its ability, which would send all of Yusei's traps on his field back to his deck.

Yusei then denies this, stating that he will still have hope not matter what happens, and tells Z-ONE that he is not him. Seeing that Yusei still refuses to believe him, Z-ONE decides to show him his memory.

However, Z-ONE then sacrifices Infinite Machine Ein Soph, to activate Infinite Light Ein Soph Aur, a trap that lets him keep all of his monsters on the field, and returns Sandaion's attack points from 0 to 4,000.

After Yusei and Z-ONE talk about the right of changing the future, Z-ONE angrily blasts a hole in the building, and flies back up into the sky. Z-ONE then feels angry at Yusei, for reducing his life points by such a great amount, and tells Yusei that he will now prove to him that hope, and the possibility to fix the future without New Domino City's destruction, which Yusei believes in, was nothing before his power.

Sephiron's first special ability then revives 4 of Z-ONE's Temporal Machine Gods, which are Metaion, Zadion, Gabrion, and Sandaion, and grants them attack and defense points of 4,000. Sephiron's next special ablility then raises its own attack points from 4,000 to 20,000, as that is the total of all of the Temporal Machine Gods' attack points, including Sephiron's. Although Shooting Star Dragon is destroyed when ZONE attacks with Sephiron, Yusei survives the attack, thanks to his trap, Clustering Wishes, and manages to summon out Stardust Dragon. Yusei then uses the other trap's effects to give it an even stronger power of 23,000 attack points.
