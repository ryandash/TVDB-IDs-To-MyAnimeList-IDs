                    "SummaryEnglish": "On the street there's a mixture of confusion and assumption. Out there, it is mostly assumed that with every scientific breakthrough, God is more and more redundant. Yet instinctively, the vast majority of people in the world feel \"there must be something\". Well, is there? What's the evidence? That's the territory of The God Question series.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "For centuries there had seemed no way of understanding how life had emerged and developed on earth other than it being God's handiwork. BUT with Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution there was a seismic shift â€“ one that, ever since, seems to have diminished God. Examining this proposition is at the heart of Life, Evolution and The God Question.",

How does it link to our sense of being conscious human beings with a sense of the past, the present, the future and of each other? Science is unable to explain why consciousness exists or what it is.",
