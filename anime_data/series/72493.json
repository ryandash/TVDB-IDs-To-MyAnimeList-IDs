One wrong turn down an alley, and the man becomes a bloody crime scene, courtesy of a towering, shadowy figure.    Two detectives converge on the alley to collect evidence, but they're interrupted by four females belonging to AMP (the Attacked Mystification Police Department), a division of the Tokyo police force. Judging from how they are greeted by the two male cops, their organization doesn't command much respect from others in the department.    AMP is there because they specialize in destroying the Lucifer Hawk, the perpetrator of this crime and a life form discovered at the turn of the century that feeds on humans.    Unfortunately, the creature is still around, and emerges from through a wall ready for another meal. Something, however, captures its attention and it takes off in pursuit. What the Lucifer Hawk s",

Expecting a smooth landing, Katsumi instead notices the Lucifer Hawk that sensed her arrival to the city standing on the wing of her plane. She awakens to burning pieces of the aircraft -- and to the creature as well, which chases her down and corners her.    The members of AMP arrive just in time, but their efforts to control the Lucifer Hawk are for the most part ineffective. Katsumi then calls upon a power she herself didn't realize she had, and destroys the creature.    Cheyenne arrives shortly afterwards to explain as much as she can. Though information concerning the threat she just faced is scarce, it is known that there are three types of Lucifer Hawks.

By the time two officers reach her room, a category-three Lucifer Hawk has already shown Katsumi secrets from her past. What she learns is apparently interesting enough to make her go to police headquarters with her two AMP bodyguards.    While there, she again meets up with the creature that offered her a glimpse into her past. To the dismay of AMP, she seemingly decides to join him in their world, a place called Nemesis. She ultimately rejects the creature, but she'll have some backup against his future wrath, as she finally accepts AMP's invitation to join their elite force.    There's only one small problem -- she was a secretary in Hawaii only days earlier, and her utter lack of skill clearly shows through. To ensure her improvement, AMP brings in a talented bu",

Though they crash land in the most dangerous part of the city, Katsumi is able to carry her injured and unconscious partner to safety, barely eluding a gang of masked criminals with a particularly strong hatred for cops. The sergeant never thought she'd get as far as she did, which can only mean that her training is complete.    Unfortunately, his problem with authority may have rubbed off on Katsumi, because she disobeys orders and runs off from the rest of the group to confront a category two Lucifer Hawk on her own.    When she's confronted by Cheyenne she makes things worse by saying that she thought she could fight the creature by herself. This enrages her boss and alienates her teammates, who consi",

Though she truly believed she was capable of confronting a Lucifer Hawk on her own, the only thanks she receives comes in the form of a stern reprimand from Rally Cheyenne and a cold shoulder from the others.    How does Katsumi respond? By again striking out on her own to chase down a Lucifer Hawk. This time, however, she walks right into an ambush and is quickly surrounded by far more of the creatures than she can possibly handle on her own.    Yuki, the only AMP member who has made any effort to get to know Katsumi, has just finished a long heart-to-heart talk with her, so she's luckily close enough to send out a distress signal. Thanks to some persuasive words from Yuki, Katsumi finally earns the friendship of all the AMP members.

At the last possible second, Katsumi uses her dagger to wound her unsuspecting assailant, but she is herself badly injured as a result and must be hospitalized.    Katsumi's father brought the Lucifer Hawk into this world, which is why they feel it's her responsibility to open the gates of Nemesis for them.

Surprisingly, the voice does not belong to the Lucifer Hawk, but rather to Grosspoliner, the mystical sword that once belonged to her father. Freeing Grosspoliner from the tower that has served as its prison since the turn of the century, Katsumi finds both a new companion and a powerful ally in the battle against the Lucifer Hawks.

It would make a lovely addition to her cafÃ©, but she can barely afford the beans, let alone the grinder. Yuki tries to walk away, but she doesn't have the willpower. She turns around to pick up her latest purchase. Walking into the store is easy. Asking the price is the hard part. But the elderly shopkeeper stuns her by saying he isn't interested in money. For this generosity, he wants only one thing in return: her life. The shopkeeper reveals himself to be a Lucifer Hawk, and he has orders from Rally's sister Rosa to exterminate the AMP, one member at a time. The battle ends in a standstill with Yuki unconscious and on the grass in a park far from the antique shop. There's definitely something strange going on. After she wakes up and picks up a newspaper, Yuki figures it out. The date is 1997. Yuki has woken up a full 30 years in the past. She's freaked out at first, but Yuki eventually finds a friend in Toru Washio, who",

The police department already had its hands full with the Lucifer Hawks, but now there's also a serial killer on the loose. After a dozen people are strangled, the cops finally crack the case. Unfortunately, the suspect in custody is AMP member Kiddy Phenil. Given her violent temper, Kiddy is certainly capable of murder, but she's no serial killer. She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. After investigating a scream she heard coming from a dark alley, Kiddy encounters the real culprit, a killer cyborg known as a megadyne. Kiddy tries to battle the megadyne, but after touching it she feels too weak to go on. The megadyne flees, leaving Kiddy with blood on her hands and surrounded by cops. Things only get worse for Kiddy when her boyfriend, Ralph Bombers, is thrown off the case after a run-in with the commissioner. Ignoring orders from above, Ralph sets out with Katsumi to find to real killer while the rest of the te",

This time it's Katsumi, who excuses herself from the table and goes home even before their meal arrives. She continues to act strangely the next day at work, moping around the office, until she finally seeks advice from Rally. Katsumi asks her if she's ever been in love, to which Rally responds that she's given up all hope for happiness, and instead takes comfort in her work. Though they both possess Lucifer Hawk blood, Rally insists that Katsumi's situation is different from her own, that she is much further removed from her evil heritage. Though what Rally says is true, it's of little comfort to Katsumi, especially when Roy has said he would not be able to kill her if she eventually turned into a Lucifer Hawk. Roy was recently unable to kill a co-worker transformed into a monster during the course of a top secret police investigation, so there's no w",

It's both their day off today, and though they were originally supposed to spend it together, Katsumi is now sitting alone in a diner, drowning her sorrows in a plate of cookies. Unfortunately, Lum Cheng -- the only person she'd want to see less than Roy at this point -- comes into the restaurant and sits in the booth behind her. Lum Cheng has a thing for Roy, and Katsumi is shocked that she isn't out with him right now, especially since after dumping him she told her that she was free to move in for the kill. After some heated words, something that usually accompanies a conversation with the obnoxious Lum Cheng, Katsumi tries to smooth things over by offering her AMP teammate a cookie. Lum Cheng's reply is to tell Katsumi to stop offering things to her that she not longer wants, because she isn't a trash can.\r\n\r\nDespite that verbal barb, Katsumi soon",
