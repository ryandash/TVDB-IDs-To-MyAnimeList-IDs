                    "SummaryEnglish": "As a plasma bomb the size of Marlon Brando hangs over the Japones capital and Geltland Marionettes menace Japones's borders, Otaru springs into action, but Lime, utterly devastated by Emperor Ieyasu's death, refuses to leave his side despite Cherry and Bloodberry's entreaties. The others streak off in the direction of the bomb, but on the way they are stopped by the Geltland Saberdolls, who declare that anyone who defies their lord, Faust, must die. Just as Otaru is about to get severely asswhupped, Lime, who suddenly pulls herself together, saves him, her instinct for protecting Otaru for the moment overwhelming her devotion to her \"grandpa\", followed by Cherry and Bloodberry. However, even Lime's timely intervention may not be enough to save our heroes - an ominous electrical storm is brewing above their heads, and the Saberdools aren't frightened by total electrocution as long as they take their opponents with them. A bolt leaps out of the clouds - and is mostly absorbed by the bomb. However, Lime and Tiegel are still struck, and the roof of the building that they're on is trashed. When the smoke clears, Tiegel struggles to her feet and moves to finish Lime, but Otaru shields her with his body, despite Lime's entreaties to move so that he won't die. At that moment, Tamasaburo and Baiko appear in the air above them and speak - with the voices of Ieyasu and Hikozaemon, who had their brainwave patterns temporarily transferred into the two guard robots. They tell Otaru and the Marionettes to hasten to the castle - the Saberdolls will be taken care of. As the bomb makes its way to the palace, destroying indiscriminately along the way, Otaru tries to puzzle out Ieyasu's final words to him: that there is something in the courtyard of the palace, and the password for it is \"checkmate, fork rook\". In the courtyard, Lime recognizes Ieyasu's favorite game: a gigantic shougi (similar to chess) board built vertically into a wall, with long metal tumblers for the pieces that a",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Now that there is no living ruler of Japones, Bloodberry muses aloud, they'll have to pick a 16th Emperor of Japones, and if they have any sense they'll pick Otaru. This prospect excites Cherry - she'll get to be the first lady! She can see it now - a laughing, leering Otaru, wearing a black robe and scary makeup, forcing Cherry to undress and ravishing her before his court - no! Otaru should definitely NOT be Emperor! At the same time, half a world away, the Saberdolls have been cast out of the court of Faust again, permanently this time - that is, unless they can bring him the otome kairo of Lime, Cherry and Bloodberry. Nobody expects them to return successfully, or even alive. Meanwhile, the minds of the previous Emperor and Chamberlain in the bodies of Tamasaburo and Baiko soothe the Japones parliament, and reconstruction work on the castle continues. Bloodberry is hauling stuff around, Cherry is mixing the concrete (albeit somewhat inattentively) and Lime - well, Lime is trying to help, but she winds up just running around, dragging Hanagata behind her. Suddenly, Lime's knees begin to spark. She stops, sending Hanagata flying into the concrete, and Gen-nai opines that she's probably got frayed knee-cables. In fact, all three Marionettes could use some repair, and Otaru resolves to fix them up at once. Otaru takes the Marionettes back to the charred remains of the Japones History Museum and roots around until he finds the secret door to the room where he found Lime and where Ieyasu showed him the Multicolored Monkey-Meter. Otaru brushes aside the question of whether he's qualified to do Marionette repair - he didn't do all those odd jobs for nothing! After dodging Hanagata's attempt to serve as his nurse and Bloodberry's, Lime's and Hanagata's entreaties to examine their chests, Otaru gets down to business. At last, after much hardship, Tiegel, Luche and Panter reach Japones. They haven't been repaired since the battle with JaponesGar, and are forced to take ene",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "When Lime fled in horror at Tiegel's death, she encountered Soemon Obiichi, Otaru's swordmaster. At his query, Lime poured forth her confusion about hearts - they make her and her \"sisters\" happy, but they also cause so much pain...! What's the point of having a heart at all? Soemon offers to help her out of this misery, and by the time Otaru finds Lime, her heart - her otome kairo - is gone. Lime is stiff and unresponsive and her pupils have closed completely, but she's still alive. Otaru takes her home and puts her to bed. A crowd gathers in Otaru's house that before long is scouring Japones town for Lime's missing \"heart\", and Otaru joins them despite objections that he should stay with Lime. Soemon tries to console Otaru, saying that Lime is Lime, missing hardware or not. Otaru goes home and finds Lime waiting in the genkan (place to change shoes), up and around but still almost totally unresponsive to any stimulus. She is capable of responding to commands, but her movements are so stiff and uncoordinated as to be without effect. However, the old Lime, though not in evidence at the moment, is not gone completely... Meanwhile, Faust receives a report from a loyal minion in the field, Rubens, that an otome kairo has been captured from one of the Japones Marionettes. Rubens signs off and removes his disguise - it is in fact none other than Soemon himself, who took Lime's otome kairo as a loyal secret agent of Geltland - in his mind, he is Soemon Obiichi of Geltland no longer. His defection was triggered by, of all things, a Marionette. Her name is Koyuki, and though she is no more animated or human than Lime is now, Soemon felt from the moment he first saw her that they were destined to spend their lives together. This intimacy with what remains, sentio-epistemiology aside, a machine earned him nothing but hatred from the Japones citizenry. Ultimately, he was kicked out of the country in disgrace. He wandered through the desert to Geltland, where he was found by Fa",

However, even though the weather is nice and everyone gets off to an early start, they are unable to ditch Hanagata successfully - though late and still clad in his official Otaru PJ's, he arrives, loudly bemoaning his mistreatment. After Lime breaks the generator that Gennai brought, Otaru is sent upstream to a potter of Gennai's acquaintance to get some earthenware so that they can barbecue the old-fashioned way. At the mention of Gennai's name, the potter agrees to lend some real nice dishes 'n' stuff to Otaru and shows him the kiln. The potter and his assistants have found an underground plasma reservoir that, though quite temperamental, can cook up pottery 10 times as fast as a normal kiln when it's working properly. This gives Otaru an idea... Meanwhile, Lime is getting very bored without Otaru around to entertain her. Hanagata tries to introduce her to fishing, but an argument over technique leads to the creation of a whirlpool by Lime that opens a chasm in the riverbed that drains all the water into an underground cavern. Meanwhile, Otaru is busily painting pottery and Geltland is testing a device, similar to the Tower of Babel in Nadia, that cuts through the smog above the Geltland capital, giving it the first sunshine some of its inhabitants have seen in generations and sending all the nasty weather elsewhere... Sure enough, all the weather winds up right on top of the barbecue, bemusing Gennai and making Lime worry about Otaru's lateness more than ever. At last Otaru returns, plates in hand, and apologizes to Cherry and Bloodberry for his lateness - walking right past Lime. Though unintentional, this sends Lime into an even deeper funk, and she goes and sulks in the rain. Even when the rain stops and the steaks are being sizzled up",

Also, once they have the otome kairo from Lime, Cherry and Bloodberry, they will be able to complete the Sabelberg II, the sequel to the big bunny-eared blitzbomb that was so soundly defeated by JaponesGar a while back. The Marionettes have fun new toys, too: their custom-made limited edition one-firing-day-only Otaru Mamiya teacups. Bloodbery is on her 15th cup of tea of the morning, Lime refuses to eat or drink out of anything but her teabowl, and Cherry has given her teacup a place of honor at the family shrine. However, they don't get to revel for long - their pleasant lunch with Hanagata (who simply will NOT behave himself) is interrupted by the arrival of Hikozaemon in Baiko's body, who summons Otaru and his girls (and, by default, Hanagata) to a conference at the royal palace. Ieyasu in the body of Tamasaburo is presiding, and present are the leaders of the other free countries of the world: President Joy (male) of New Texas, Wong of Xian, Villé of Romana and Alec of Peterubulbu, which is technically no longer a free country, being overrun by Geltland. The leaders of the free world are sick of Geltland's antisocial behavior, and since Otaru has been to Geltland before and even took out a supercomputer there once (by kissing it full on the lips, true...), he is the perfect person to go in and whack Faust once and for all. At this moment, the Marionettes sense something, a disturbance that only their otome kairo can perceive: the approach of the Saber Beast Leopard. Following close behind it is a massive body of Geltland panzers, led personally by Faust. Faust is still haunted by his memories of Lorelei - his ancestor, all of whose memories he has, was in love with her, and resolved that he, or one of his clones, would someday come to save her.

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Fifteen generations ago, Lorelei, an Earthling scientist on board the colonization ship Mesopotamia, designed a central computer for the new colony to be established on Terratoo. Evidently something of an Evangelion fan, she used three different aspects of her personality to give the computer humanlike thoughts and emotions, making it almost as if it were alive, and thus able to think creatively and kill off the crew if they become a problem and so forth. In fact, by the time the Mesopotamia reached Terratoo, she had nearly finished it - all that remained was to iron out some emotional instabilities... Flash forward to the present. The same computer, still aboard the Mesopotamia, has awakened and appears to be attacking those dwelling on the planet's surface, firing probes that smash the ground open and produce flashes of electrical energy that paralyze any electronics within range, including Marionettes and Saberdolls. One of these nearly causes Faust to be crushed by one of his own tanks, but he is saved by Panter and Luche. He asks where Tiegel is, but answers his own question: she died like a dog! Needless to say, this does not sit well with her comrades, and Faust has to shoot Panter to keep her from stepping out of line. Meanwhile, the Leopard is still attacking Otaru and crew, having recovered from the electrical jolt. The Marionettes take off over the rooftops, hoping to draw it away from Otaru, and this works out very well considering that the Marionettes, or, more specifically, their otome kairo, are the targets. Telling Otaru to join the rest of the population of Japones in the underground shelters (more Eva), the girls dash off back toward the ruined part of the city and succeed in crushing the Leopard under a falling building. But it's not dead, it's just resting. Though much of its simulated flesh has been ripped off, exposing its endoskeleton and eyeballs, it'll be back to terminate the Marionettes, so they dash off and hide in an apartment building u",

Wasting no time, Ieyasu lays out the plan: Japones is prepared to use JaponesGar to attack the Mesopotamia, but since the current incarnation of JaponesGar is stationary, Japones needs Geltland's plasma diffuser (see episode 21) and rocket-booster technology to escape Terratoo's somewhat hostile atmosphere and get to the offending spacecraft. At this point, Otaru interjects that he was under the impression that the Mesopotamia was completed destroyed 300 years ago - that's why the six survivors were sent to the surface with little or no hope of survival, right? As it turns out, the admittedly harder-to-take truth is that the Mez is, in fact, still there. Its artificial-intelligence computer, the one Lorelei designed, went insane, took over the ship, killed most of the crew and took Lorelei hostage. Actually, it took Lorelei for a mate, and she's been in suspended animation ever since. Faust was going to save her himself, but then Otaru SCREWED EVERYTHING UP! However, he is interrupted in mid-blame by a spookily familiar voice. Out of the darkness of the cavern lurches Tiegel, supported by a tangle of RCA cables and missing a few parts. One such part is her memory - the only thing left is her knowledge of the pre-brainwashing Faust she used to love and pamper. She mutters something about the lorelei being in bloom, then collapses into Faust's arms. Greatly disquieted, Faust orders everyone but Otaru into the next chamber. If Otaru thought the Mesopotamia thing was a shock, he doesn't know from being shocked. Faust, once he and Otaru are alone with the inert Tiegel, finishes the story of the Mesopotamia. It seems that the purpose of Faust I and Ieyasu I in creating the otome kairo was a desperate plan to free Lorelei. Using Lorelei's same paradigm of",

But then, the computer's chattering mind suddenly stops, and as the attack on the surface of Terratoo continues, JaponesGar punches through the Mesopotamia's hull. Once inside, it doesn't take Luche long to ascertain the location of the heart of the Mesopotamia's computer. Though the Mesopotamia's interior defenses are more than adequate, they're no match for the Marionettes and Saberdolls. In fact, one of the rockets launched at the Marionettes is quickly put to a most unintended use, as the girls turn it around and ride it down the dark corridor, laughing all the way. Bells on bobtails ring, making spirits bright, and Luche wonders at this behavior - how can the girls laugh and sing, Lime especially, since they'll probably die tonight? To answer this question, one must journey deep into Lime's memory, to a sunny afternoon when she and Otaru weren't doing anything in particular. Contemplating a vast grassy field, Lime asks Otaru about the nature of happiness. Otaru's view: happiness derives from the fact that the sky is blue, the clouds are white, the grass and forest are green. In other words, happiness is the fact that it's great to be alive. Thus did Otaru teach the Marionettes the nature of happiness - it's the beauty of the world and the smiles of loved ones and the very fact of being alive. As they rocket along on the rocket, Lime, Cherry and Bloodberry remember every happy moment they've spent with Otaru, and feel as if he were there on the rocket with them. Before they know it, our robotic protagonists have come to the vast, dark chamber housing the central computer. The motif is Creepy Biomechanical, and Ieyasu and Hikozaemon distract the mechanic",
