They were invader who tried to drive out the earthian from the earth, and make the earth their hometown. On the other hand, there were some objects which had been fired into the earth from the different star about 300 years ago. They were three space battleships and three combat robots. They were the one which had been sent to oppose Zenopares which would invade the earth before long. Three battleships and robots implanted the gene to a clan surrounding them, and disappeared into the earth. \r\n\r\nIn 2000's, Zenopares reaches the earth at last.
