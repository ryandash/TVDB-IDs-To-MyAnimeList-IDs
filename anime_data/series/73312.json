    "TitleEnglish": "Dirty Pair Flash",
    "SummaryEnglish": "Dirty Pair Flash is related to the original Dirty Pair, with the same characters but there are some changes. Dirty Pair Flash was released later but it is something of a prequel, showing the two main characters on their first assignments. It contains animated violence and mayhem, some profanity and a small amount of nudity. The DVD release is rated 15 and up. The Pair consists of two 17-year-old junior level 'Trouble Consultants', a cross between a trouble-shooter and a secret agent. They work for an organization called World Welfare & Works Association or the 3WA which handles problems galaxy-wide. Their codename is 'Lovely Angels' but it's easy to see why they are eventually known as the Dirty Pair, not in a naughty way, but because they tend to leave ruination wherever they go. Yuri is the purple-haired and perky team member, she is occasionally zany and a bit distracted. Yuri tends to rely on her feminine wiles to get out of trouble, rarely plans ahead and is obsessed wit",
