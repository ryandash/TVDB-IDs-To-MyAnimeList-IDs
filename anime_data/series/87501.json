Meanwhile, Yui has Nodoka over to help with her homework, and gets upset when she eats the strawberry off her cake. Later, Tsumugi asks Ritsu to hit her, wanting the same skinship  she has with Mio, but Ritsu cannot bring herself to do it. As a compromise, Ritsu attempts to train Tsumugi to be dopey enough that Mio would hit her instead, but to no avail. Hoping to make an opportunity, Tsumugi eats the strawberry off Mio's cake, but this just makes her cry. Having given up when a direct request to Mio also fails, Tsumugi finally gets hit when she implies Ritsu would be popular with the girls if she was a boy.",
