                    "SummaryEnglish": "Though it seemed Ryouma had betrayed the Hunters, Astamon reveals to Tagiru he is the embodiment of Quartzmon's Terminal and has been manipulating Ryouma the entire time. Assuming his true form, Quartzmon reveals that he used Ryouma to obtain enough Digimon data to construct his main body before fusing into it and burrowing underground to turn Earth into data to asborb. The Old Clock Store Owner has everyone gather around him to lend the power from their Xros Loaders, while having Clockmon temporaryily freeze time to halt Quartzmon's digitizing of all life on Earth long enough for Tagiru to obtain the Brave Snatcher. Taiki then passes his goggles to Tagiru, asking him to hunt Quartzmon using the combined strength of himself, Tai, Davis, Takato, Takuya and Marcus. While the others are digitized, Tagiru and Arresterdramon proceed to hunt down Quartzmon with the latter assuming Superior Mode and Digi-Xrossing with the Brave Snatcher to destroy Quartzmon at the root. With Quartzmon reduced to a DigiEgg and everything restored, the DigiDestined, Tamers, Legendary Warriors, and DATS agents return to their universes while the Xros Heart and Hunter Digimon return to their respective human and Digital worlds. However, a month later, Gumdramon returns to the real world and is reunited with Tagiru. The Old Clock Store Owner appears in front of Taiki and Yuu, revealing himself as a ressurrected Bagramon and that he wanted to help them stop Quartzmon, a by-product of his evil. He also reveals that some Digimon have remained in their world and tells them to be on their guard.",
