Determined to straighten out what she expects to be a group of incompetent fools, she instead finds a team of well-intentioned experts who use very effective—albeit unorthodox—methods, hindered by strict regulations. With their newest member by their side, Unit Eight fights crime and overcomes unexpected adversaries in Active Raid: Kidou Kyoushuushitsu Dai Hachi Gakari.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Bird has loaded the orbital base of the Space Elevator with explosives, and is threatening to ram it down onto Tokyo. If it lands, it will destroy the city along with most of Japan. To stop it, Unit 8 and the USDF concoct a daring plan that involves the use of willwear in space. Kuroki and Miho volunteer for this dangerous mission, and the rest of Unit 8 works together to get them up into orbit. When they arrive, however, they find that Bird has laid one final trap: a trio of deadly autonomous willwear. When Miho is knocked away from the satellite, Kuroki is forced to engage them alone. Can he defeat the enemy willwear and save the city that Inagi loved!?",
