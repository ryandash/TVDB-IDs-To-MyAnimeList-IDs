The pitch-black wilderness is infested with Gaichuu--colossal insects with metal exoskeletons. The Gaichuu make travel between the cities of Amberground extremely dangerous. But thankfully the Letter Bees, a brave corps of messengers, risk their lives in order to keep the hearts of Amberground connected.  Gauche Suede is on his last delivery before a big promotion. In the outskirts of Yodaka, the darkest area of Amberground, Gauche is surprised to find that the package is a young boy named Lag Seeing. Lag had been traumatized by his mother's abduction and is due to be delivered to his aunt. In this remote area rife with Gaichuu, Lag and Gauche face a dangerous journey that inspires Lag to become a Letter Bee.",

Although Lag promised not to tell, he shoots a shindan into the letter, which reveals a flashback of Ray's childhood. It turns out Ray met and befriended Kimidori when she was young. Before she moved, Ray gives her a matching hairpin as proof of their friendship. When Kimidori grew older, her family owed debts and she is forced to sell the hairpin. Feeling guilty for having sold the hairpin, Kimidori leaves home to search for Ray's current residence and eventually finds it. She then plants the Blue Romeo in the garden to remind Ray of her childhood. Ray reunites with Kimidori and thanks her for the happy memories.

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Aria and Niche head to Houdai Franklin's house. Franklin attacks them upon meeting but Aria manages to convince him that she just wants to know the truth about the Day of Flicker. In flashback, Franklin was an engineer working on the airship with his friend Negich. The purpose of using the airship to travel to the artificial sun wasn't explained to the construction crew. A number of characters such as Dr. Thunderland Jr., a group of Bee triplets (with two of them serving as the gatekeeper between Bifrost and Yuusari in the present) were present aboard the ship. When Franklin wanted to steer the ship in order to get a clearer look at Akatsuki, the artificial sun gave out and flickered a few times. This momentary lapse in the sun's rays caused a huge disturbance among the crew, Franklin included, who claimed to see a monster in the sun calling for its \"mother\". Soon after, the airship crashed and most of them died except for Franklin, Thunderland Jr., the triplets and Balor, the general commander sent to oversee the operation. Each of them are left either partially or completely blinded. Meanwhile, Lag takes a turn for the worse and his heart energies are in danger of overflowing. When Thunderland Jr. and his staff try to stop the flow, they witness Lag involuntarily summoning visual flashbacks of his life with some imagery appearing not to be seen elsewhere before. After Lag recovers, Gauche wakes up with his memories returned, much to the delight of everyone, especially Sylvette. While Lag reunites with Gauche, Franklin tells Aria that he believes that the artificial sun is an abomination that will eventually consume all the hearts of the inhabitants and it is too late for Gauche to ever recover his lost memories.",

Both men want to know how Gauche is able to regain his lost heart as well as what happened during the period he was in Akatsuki. However, Largo allows Gauche to return home for the night as he believes this will be better for his well-being. Lag tells Gauche the good news and will pick him up after his delivery, but Gauche decides to accompany him as his dingo. Although Lag feels that he's not a wonderful Bee, Gauche tells him that by returning his lost heart to him, he is one. Gauche apologizes to Lag for not able to keep his promise to look for his mother in Akatsuki. Back home, Sylvette welcomes Gauche back and thanks Lag for keeping his promise. Roda returns alive, as she spies on Gauche at his house. Thunderland Jr. warns Largo that since Gauche can access the memories that Lag does, it's possible he's still Noir pulling off a deception on them. The next morning, Lag discovers that Gauche has disappeared from his room. Meanwhile, the capital inspectors inform Lawrence on Gauche's regaining his memories. Since he can't be a Marauder anymore, Lawrence orders the inspectors to dispose of him. He then peers down a cliff to an unknown gaichuu.",
