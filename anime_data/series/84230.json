Miyagi attempts to reassure himself with the fact that he is the one who is being chased, but fails with the realization that he is at the mercy of the teenage boy. Miyagi tries to call Shinobu, but Miyagi's ex-wife answers. After a short conversation, Miyagi finally realizes the issues troubling Shinobu. Miyagi searches through his calendar for an appropriate day to confront Shinobu, only to find a particular date circled. At first, Miyagi questions the significance of the date, then suddenly realizes that the date circled was one he would normally never forget: the date of death of the woman he loved years ago. Several days later, Miyagi drives to Shinobu's school only to find him with a foreigner. At the sight of Miyagi, Shinobu grabs the foreigner's hand and runs in the opposite direction. Miyagi chases Shinobu with his car and, at the peak of his anger, plays a scenario in his mind of what their supposed break up will be like. Wearing a disguise, Miyagi manages to confront Shinobu, and learns Shinobu's side of the story. Miyagi realizes how insecure Shinobu became upon discovering that the only object Miyagi truly cherishes is a photo of him and his past love. Miyagi throws Shinobu into his car, and after a long drive, they end up at the grave of Miyagi's former love. There, Miyagi confesses his love for Shinobu and requests forgiveness, as he will finally let go of his past love.",

She tells him that renting a room at a five-star hotel is not a normal date, then laments about finding a normal college student to teach him what a normal date is like. She asks Misaki to take Usagi on a date and show him what it is like. Misaki reluctantly agrees. A package from Usagi’s father arrives--a wooden carving of a bear with four salmon--and Misaki is forced to reveal that he had recently met with both Usagi’s father and Usagi’s brother. Usagi is deeply upset by this, but refuses to say why. The two go on their date, eating at a diner and heading to a newly renovated aquarium where Misaki again runs into Usagi’s brother when he goes to the bathroom. Misaki tells Usagi’s brother to try and mend his relationship with his well-meaning father, then is subjected to yet another love confession. He tries to get away, but is spotted by Usagi. The two end their date on a ferris wheel where Usagi reveals that he is afraid that if Misaki continues to run into his family, they will reveal things about Usagi that Misaki has never seen. He worries that finding out about these things will make Misaki hate him and leave him, and he would rather Misaki leave now than come to hate him later. Misaki tells Usagi that he would never do that because he loves him. The two reconcile, then head to a hotel and shower together. Later, Misaki expresses embarrassment over saying \"I love you\" so easily, but feels that it was worth it if it made Usagi feel better. Then he discovers that Usagi-san used it as material for yet another BL novel but still hasn't finished the novel he was supposed to be writing...",

Usagi refuses to marry her but Misaki coaxes him to allow her to stay until she can figure out what to do. While Usagi is out buying cigarettes Usagi’s brother rings the doorbell looking for Kaoruko. To distract him, Misaki agrees to go for a drive with him to protect Kaoruko, and asks Kaoruko to tell Usagi that he will be back in 3 hours. In the car Usagi’s brother tells Misaki that he will not marry Kaoruko. He also talks about his difficult childhood and how it has always made him seek the approval of others, and how his real dream is to be an architect. Misaki realises that Usagi’s brother isn't such a bad guy. Misaki gets out of the car and runs straight into Usagi’s father, who tells him that his existence is a problem and a threat to the stability of his family. Misaki is shocked and hurt, and rushes home to Usagi because he promised he'd be back in 3 hours. Usagi can see that Misaki is upset, but Misaki pretends he's fine and won't reveal what Usagi’s father said because he doesn't want to cause trouble. That night in bed Usagi begs Misaki to talk to him, to tell him what's bothering him, because he's worried. Misaki won't talk about it and promises himself that he will disguise his feelings better in the future. The next day, Kaoruko admits that she likes Misaki, which makes him proud that finally a girl likes him.",

At the hot spring Usagi tells Misaki that he refused the inheritance of 1.3 billion yen (~$14 million). While Usagi works on a manuscript Misaki soaks in the hot spring, and he runs into Usagi’s father. Usagi’s father asks Misaki some questions about his relationship with Usagi, expressing surprise that they get along. Usagi’s father describes Usagi as emotionally fragile. Because he wants his son to be happy, he doesn't want Misaki to stay with Usagi if his feelings are half-hearted. Misaki passes out in the tub, but when he awakens he tells Usagi what happened and Usagi says everything is fine. When Usagi disappears for a long time to buy cigarettes Misaki goes looking for him and finds him talking to his father. He eavesdrops and hears Usagi’s father say that Misaki will one day become a burden to him. Misaki confronts them and says there is nothing half-hearted about his feelings.
