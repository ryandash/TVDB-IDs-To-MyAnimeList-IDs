They have been asked to solve a case revolving around the disturbing letters being sent to the Head Chef, Unno Kouji. As soon as they arrive, however, Neuro predicts that the real mystery is about to happen. They are greeted by the owner Shirota Masakage, who after briefly introducing them to the Head Chef, takes them to his office where he shows the detectives the two threatening letters the restaurant received. Mere moments later, Unno is discovered dead in the kitchen. There are no suspects due to the circumstances. However, when Yako tastes one of Shirota's dishes, regarding it as \"not food\", Neuro becomes interested in him. With the help of the 777 Tools of the Demon World and his reasoning, he discovers that Shirota was the murderer and eats his mystery. He is arrested for murder and for cooking with the use of drugs (the source of glory and success for his food).",

By acquring a security tape through Godai which shows that Hime was present the day of the crime, Neuro makes Yako join the site to use her as bait by writing in her profile that she knows who the culprit is. The next day, Yako shows up in the intersection, walking by herself. A crowded group surrounds her, and right in the middle Hime appears before Yako in order to kill her; but at the last minute Godai shows up disguised, takes the blow, and is wounded. Because they couldn't tape the moment that Hime hurt Godai, they call her to the office and trick her to admit she is the murderer. She confesses, and tries to kill Neuro, but he stops her with his demonic power and eats her mystery. The episode ends with Yako leaving Links for good.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Neuro is stabbed by spears over an altar that drains his power, and Sai is about to cut him open until Yako stops him. Yako reveals she has figured out who Sai was. Sai becomes shocked by the truth. An earthquake shakes the altar and Neuro is reawakened to full power. He reveals the altar is an entrance to hell and is now opening. Sai collapses from exhaustion after losing to Neuro. Everyone leaves the pyramid as the ground has become unstable with the opening of hell. Neuro says goodbye to Yako as he flies towards the portal and uses all his powers to seal the gate. Yako notes that all has returned to normal, though Neuro hasn't come back. The episode's \"epilogue\" is after a short time skip; Sasazuka and Ishigaki are at a crime scene, and Ishigaki notes that it's much quieter now that the detectives aren't around. Yako is seen at the now-barren office, having finished packing all of the mystery-related items away. Akane is revealed to be \"dead\" again because of Neuro's lack of demonic influence. Godai enters the office and says a sad but gruff goodbye, now that Neuro isn't there to enslave him anymore. Yako resigns herself to a life without Neuro, when two men enter the office, one of them begging Yako to save him from death before being yanked away. Yako, confused, muses over what happened at the door, while, in the background, colour returns to Akane's white body. A hand reaches out and grabs Yako's head, and Yako, though in pain, delightedly turns around to see Neuro, returned, on the ceiling, the scent of mystery on the tip of his tongue.",
