    "SummaryEnglish": "During a commando operation carried out by an animal rights organization in a biological research institute, a pregnant chimpanzee is discovered, which will give birth to a \"humanzee\", a half-human, half-chimpanzee being. Named Charlie, he is raised by human parents for fifteen years. Neither human nor animal, his behavior and his sensitivity will create sparks within the community. But Charlie is unaware that elsewhere, a group of vegan activists seek to make of him their emblem.\r\nWhen Charlie entered high school, he met Lucy, a girl who was ridiculed as a \"nerd\" but was a bright girl, and developed friendship with him. However, the ALA (Animal Liberation Alliance), which \"repeatedly engages in terrorist activities in search of animal liberation\", adds Charlie to its comrades and \"plans to lure him into terrorism\", taking extreme measures. It causes the townspeople to change their attitude towards Charlie and his family.",
