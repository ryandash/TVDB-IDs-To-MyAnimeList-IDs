As it grows more afraid, it is revealed that this Pokémon was actually Pikachu and Psyduck carrying a mushroom they had found as the two are confused.

Pikachu and Psyduck seem exhausted, while Jigglypuff attempts to get an Oran Berry from a tree before the branch it is standing on breaks and it falls to the ground, knocking it towards the other two and rolling them over to a cave. The Pokémon are all interested by the cave, so they all walk in and find a large space for them, much to their amazement. The Pokémon used teamwork to grab berries from the trees and gather some items to set in the cave; Pikachu gathers some leaves, Jigglypuff gathers some flowers, and Psyduck gathers some sticks. As they all settle in the cave, they quickly fall asleep. Once Pikachu wakes up in the morning, it reflects on its time with Psyduck and Jigglypuff, and q",
