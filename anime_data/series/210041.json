    "SummaryEnglish": "A true treat for true fans of any genre, Otaku no Video (\"Fan's Video\") is an outrageous mockumentary that combines the superb animation that made GAINAX one of Japan's best-loved animation studios with truly strange interviews with \"real animation fans.\" The result is a thinly fictionalized history of GAINAX that segues into a truly strange SF adventure.\r\n\r\nSit back and enjoy as a small band of Otaku (fans) set out to \"Otakunize\" the human race!",

Un/fortunately for him, his life is entirely changed by a chance meeting with an old high school classmate by the name of Tanaka (their full names don't matter, as it's their feats as Otaku that earn them my admiration and respect). After being introduced to Tanaka's circle of pop culture aficionados, Kubo is slowly inoculated with the first seeds of Otakudom, transforming into the stereotypic fanboy that the fellows at Gainax mock, and yet can probably identify with. Kubo spends his time and money on anime, letting it take over his life, until even his girlfriend is fed up with his new self. Distraught and angered by her and society's misunderstanding of anime Otaku, he vows to dedicate his life to becoming the Otaking, expanding anime to such an extent that it can no longer be made fun of.",
