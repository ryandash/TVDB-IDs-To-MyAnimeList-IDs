    "SummaryEnglish": "After losing a small bet to the Great God of Galdardia, Earth's God of Fate handed over 10 low-quality souls to his rival as a reward. Taking advantage of his victory, the God of Galdardia took the opportunity to breathe these souls into new bodies, while rebirthing them in one of the worlds he oversees: a magical world. Among the 10 selected, a former salaryman who was about to get a raise after years of hard work is reincarnated in Luciel's body, with nothing but the memories of his previous life and his sharp business skills. Faced with this absurd situation, our man makes a promise to himself: his next death will be sweet and of old age. To do this, he decides to become a healer, unaware that this job is far from easy...",
