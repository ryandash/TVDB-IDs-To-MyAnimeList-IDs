Working off of a tip they got from Washington, the Cats locate one of the gunrunners' arms storage facilities, but things take a turn for the worse when the guards spot them. Bloody Pierce captures Minnie May and Rally has to race in reckless pursuit to rescue her best friend from being carved up by the sinister Russian.",
