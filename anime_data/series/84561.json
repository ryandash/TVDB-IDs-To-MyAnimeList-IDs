As Keita regains consciousness, it is revealed in the past that Kuro was to be sacrificed to the Master Tera Stone to prevent the rage of the Masagami. However, Reishin, having been against the matter, was forced to slaughter his tribe. Therefore, he had chosen to form a Contract with Akane to break the curse of the Masagami once and for all.

She and Keita now know that Reishin was not the one to really slaughter his own clan and has done all he has done up to this point in order to protect Kuro from awakening as one of the Masagami and contributing to the destruction of the world. Reishin is pounded by attacks of magma and glaciers, but with the aid of the Thousand Iolite Abyss, he unleashes the powered-up Exceed Tera Cannon to destroy the body of the two Masagami. With his last-founded attack, he uses up all his Tera and dies while impeding the Masagami's ability to regenerate.",
