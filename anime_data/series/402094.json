    "SummaryEnglish": "Reiji Kirio was a corporate wage slave, who did nothing but work all day, every day. On a typical day of walking to work with a hollow look on his face, he suddenly found himself in the forest of another world. \"Oh, this must be one of those isekai reincarnations people keep talking about.\" The two skills he has are \"Appraise\" and \"Drug Discovery.\" Those don't sound too impressive... well, whatever. Except these turn out to be particularly overpowered skills! And so, a story about following the slow life philosophy while running a drugstore in another world begins.",
