    "SummaryEnglish": "When Sonico wakes up every morning she sees big things on the horizon, but when she gets up gravity takes hold and she can focus on what is directly ahead of her for the day. And that is a good thing, because Sonico is more than just an attractive girl with a really huge set of... er... headphones. She is also an incredibly busy young woman who somehow juggles modelling and working at her grandmother's bar while attending college and performing lead vocals and playing the guitar in the all-girl band Fastest Speed in Space. How she manages to squeeze it all in is as big a mystery as how she manages to squeeze into some of her outfits or paint her toenails without falling over, but somehow she always stays balanced and abreast of the situation. Well, most of the time, anyway, and when her workload does get a little top heavy, she can count on her fellow musicians Suzu and Fuuri for a little stabilizing influence.",

So the editor spends the day observing Sonico expecting the famous model to be shallow and self-absorbed.

The while waiting in Sonico's bedroom the editor finds a notebook of Sonico's compositions and comes to respect Sonico's dedication to her music, her band and bandmates. This forces the editor to reflect on how she is living her own life.",
