    "SummaryEnglish": "May is the key to unlocking the deadliest weapon, known as the Dragoon. Early in the film, May is shown in a tube being controlled by two older men. She escapes and finds herself lost in the woods. While practicing his sword techniques, a young man named Sedon hears soldiers and airplanes nearby. He comes across a search party looking for May. Staying hidden behind a row of shrubbery, he starts to follow them before tripping over May, who is lying naked and unconscious on the floor.\r\n\r\nSedon takes May to his small cabin, built by his father, where she soon wakes up. The search party then finds the cabin and knocks on the door. Sedon and May escape just in time, but they are leaving tracks in the snow. To prevent being tracked, they run down a small nearby stream. The Searchers lose the trail and Sedon takes May back to his village, where he discovers that she has amnesia, and remembers nothing.",
