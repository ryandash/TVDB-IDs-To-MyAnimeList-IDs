    "SummaryEnglish": "In UC 0087, seven years after the end of the One Year War and following the events of Operation Stardust, the Earth Federation establishes the elite counter-insurgency division called the Titans to hunt down remaining pockets of Zeon resistance. The Titans become overzealous in their mission, resorting to brutal methods to achieive their goals, becoming nothing more than ruthless tyrants with an ambition to rule the Earth Sphere. Two anti-Titans resistance groups, the AEUG (Anti-Earth Union Group) and their Earth-bound counterparts Karaba, form to unite various existing forces in the struggle against the facist-like Titans. Their members consist of renegade soldiers of the Earth Federal forces, former soldiers of the Principality of Zeon and militia from space colonies.",

The Titans have given her false memories in hopes of preventing the personality breakdown that destroyed Four, but their plan backfired when Camille turned up looking like her fictitious older brother. The similarity of surnames -- Vidan and Vadam -- may also have been a factor. In any case, Rosamia is both a powerful and inherently unstable Newtype. \r\n\r\nAboard the Dogoth Gear, Basque orders a test of the Bound Dock (NRX-055) with Rosamia as pilot. \r\n\r\nAEUGO goes on the offensive to keep the Titans too busy to use their Colony Laser, attacking a flotilla en route to Bunch 13 (Side 2). \r\n\r\nRosamia attacks Fa's Methuss, but is driven back by Z-Gundam. Rosamia is torn between her conditioned hatred of Z-Gundam and her implanted love of her \"brother\" Camille. As they drift into Bunch 13, he tries to win her over, citing how much her playmates Qum and Shinta miss her. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Quattro finds a pair of Hizacks attaching a G-3 gas bomb to the hull and blasts it. \r\n\r\nCamille almost wins Rosamia over, but her controllers arrive in a prototype Bound Dock and activate the psycho-wave amplifier used with Four at Kilimanjaro. Rosamia tranforms her Bound Dock into its grotesque combat mode, a mechanical monster four times the size of Z-Gundam, but as before Camille can't bring himself to kill her. \r\n\r\nQuattro fires on the controller's Bound Dock and disables the psycho-wave. Rosamia loses her fighting spirit and both Bound Docks retreat. \r\n\r\nBasque returns to Grips 2 and the deadly Colony Laser.",

Katsu objects openly and is thrown into the brig along with Shinta and Qum, who joined in his disruption. \r\n\r\nCamille flies Z-Gundam under a flag of truce to the Gwadan, where Haman greets him royally.

Quattro reluctantly agrees. \r\n\r\nAt Grips 2, Basque is preparing to fire the Colony Laser at Granada. \r\n\r\nFa joins Katsu and the children in the brig to watch over them, which insults Katsu no end. The Ahgama's Mobile Suits spearhead the assault and, sensing that the tide is turning against them, Fa and Katsu join them. \r\n\r\nThe Gwadan fires a broadside that disables the Colony Laser's core pulse engine, preventing it from rotatating for a clear shot at Granada. Haman has kept her end of the bargain and saved the day. \r\n\r\nThe Ahgama links up with the Gwadan for Quattro's promised audience with Minerva and Haman. \"Char Aznable\" pledges allegiance to Zion, but \"Quattro Baijina\" recalls his repeated disclaimer: \"I am QUATTRO now!\"",

He meets up with Char (still hanging out aboard Hamaan's ship), who improves on Katsu's plan by breaking into the conference room and trying to kill *everyone* involved. As luck would have it, Scirocco has meanwhile pulled a gun on Hamaan; Char breaks in, draws a bead on Scirocco, Sara senses the threat and fires her mobile suit's beam guns through the ship and into the conference room. Total chaos ensues, and everyone flees; Scirocco finds himself alone in the room with Jamitov, and shoots him just for kicks. Then he flees the Axis flagship, telling the Titans fleet that Hamaan had Jamitov whacked. The Titans open fire on the ship and destroy it. \r\n\r\nNow that everybody's outside in their mobile suits, Hamaan and Scirocco face off in one of those newtype staring matches. Reccoa and Sara, watching from the sidelines, decide to take out Hamaan while she's distracted - but Katsu has the same idea in regards Scirocco, and comes zooming in to shoot him in the back. Sara takes the hit, saving her purple-haired Humbert Humbert.",

It's on course to plow directly into Granada, a major base of support for AEUGO and the home of its sponsor Anaheim Electronics. The AEUGO forces are ordered to drop whatever they're doing and save the corporate headquarters from imminent destruction. \r\n\r\nWhile the AEUG fleet consolidates around the colony laser, the Agama is sent to Axis for some reason that currently escapes me. Camille, nosing about the asteroid, runs into the mighty Psyco Gundam Mk.II, piloted by \"sister\" and artificial newtype Rozamia Badam. The Psyco Gundam gets stuck in the asteroid's innards, and Camille, Rozamia and Fa begin chasing each other around on foot. Rozamia is a total basket case (still), and Camille keeps getting these Four vibes from her. Fa tries to talk the addle-brained artificial newtype down, but no dice; she rushes back to the Psyco Gundam and the battle is resumed. In the end, Camille has no choice but to kill Rozamia; she thanks him for releasing her from her torment. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Scirocco eliminates his only remaining rival for control of the Titans. Basque Om's flagship, the Dogos Gear, is guarded by artificial newtype Geits Kappa, who is simultaneously \"coaching\" Rozamia; when she dies, the psychic backlash kills Geits as well, and Scirocco's forces (led by Reccoa) swarm over the Dogos Gear and blow it to bits. \r\n\r\nAEUGO uses the colony laser to fire at the asteroid Axis and divert it from its collision course.",

Thus begins the Great Character Purge. \r\n\r\nEmma and Katsu dock to form the Super Gundam and fend off Yazan's Hambrabi trio; Katsu insists on sticking around to fight in his puny cockpit capsule, and Yazan chases him into an asteroid. A furious Emma blows away Yazan's wingmen, but the enemy ace sneaks up behind her and blasts the Gundam's back. Like an idiot, Henken maneuvers the Radish into the fight to try and cover Emma - cover a mobile suit with a battleship! - and Yazan doesn't even break a sweat as he shoots the Radish to pieces. \r\n\r\nOne very funny moment: Scirocco and Reccoa charge into battle, facing about a hundred Axis mobile suits. Suddenly there's a blaze of light, as Char - sitting on the sidelines - toasts the Axis forces with his mega bazooka launcher, leaving Scirocco all dressed up with nobody to fight. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Agama contingent finally arrives. Camille is intercepted by Jerid, but shrugs him off with little effort; Jerid's crippled mobile suit spins off and plows into the wreck of the Radish, blowing whatever's left of the ship and its crew into space dust. \r\n\r\nEmma, her Gundam repaired, sets out to duel Reccoa. The two former friends strike, and Emma scores a dead hit. Emma recklessly gets out to inspect the wreck of Reccoa's mobile suit and see if she's still alive; Yazan, lurking nearby, opens fire, hits the wrecked mobile suit, and it explodes. Emma takes a hunk of burning shrapnel in the gut. Camille hulks out, chops up Yazan's mobile suit (though the fiend himself escapes), and collects Emma's dying body.",

The terrible twosome quickly dismantle Char's Type 100, and the action then shifts to the inner rooms of the super weapon. The trio are joined by Camille and Fa for more pistol-waving, pontificating, philosophizing action; then they all hop back into their mobile suits and hightail it out of the colony laser. Bright, who's been patiently waiting for his pilots to clear the barrel, then activates the colony laser and disintegrates the Titans fleet. \r\n\r\nFinal duel time! Hamaan and Char end up slugging it out inside another wrecked ship. Char almost wins, despite the fact his mobile suit has about one limb left, but he forgot about the Quebeley's funnels. Hamaan offers him a chance to live and serve her (declined), then Char nails the ship's Secret Self-Destruct Widget with the Type 100's vulcans and blows it up around them. Hamaan escapes. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Camille discovers how frustrating it is to fight an indestructible mobile suit. Giving up on defeating Scirocco through conventional means, he summons all the friendly newtype ghosts at his disposal (Emma, Four, Rozamia) to hold the cold-blooded manipulator in place (Sara's ghost almost intervenes to help her man, but Katsu's ghost talks her out of it). Transforming the Zeta into wave rider mode, Camille plows into Scirocco's mobile suit and crushes him into pulp (very memorable!). The dying Scirocco fries Camille's teeny brain in revenge. \r\n\r\nThe end. Fa collects her childhood pal, now with the IQ of a pork cutlet.
