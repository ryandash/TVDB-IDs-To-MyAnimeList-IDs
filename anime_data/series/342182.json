But before she goes through with it, her younger brother Hitaki gets her involved in an incident caused by a \"maremono,\" a type of book that casts a great influence on whoever reads it. As a result, Tsugumi gains the power to see \"aura,\" a light that represents the emotions that dwell within a maremono. This is the story of a woman whose destiny seems to sway up and down, as if on the delicate balance of a scale.",
