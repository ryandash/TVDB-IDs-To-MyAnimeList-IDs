    "SummaryEnglish": "In the 26th century, an experimental transporter sends pilot David Chance into another universe. He is dropped into the middle of a war against the evil Dark Star and his forces. In order to defeat Dark Star, the good forces combine to form Macron 1. Macron 1 was a flying space robot formed when Beta Command, led by Dr. Chagall, joined its energy and weaponry with the Macstar, piloted by David Chance. Many characters, including the little robot An-D and Wookiee-like first mate Nok, were basically Star Wars ripoffs, as was some of the storyline.\r\n\r\nThe show was originally aired in Japan as Sengoku Majin Go-Shogun - \"Demon-God of the War-Torn Land Shogun\" (1981) and as Aku Dai Sakusen Srungle - \"Great Military Operation in Subspace Srungle\" (1983-84). When dubbed and aired in America, footage from the two shows were combined into one show. This worked because the characters from one were the same characters from the other, only in an alternate universe. Current music hits were added to the English version. Duran Duran provided the intro, \"Reflex\".",
