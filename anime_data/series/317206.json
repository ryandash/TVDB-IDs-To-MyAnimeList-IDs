Meanwhile, Chinatsu is working multiple shifts to support her family as she continues her studies, and the mounting pressure to meet high expectations soon becomes overwhelming. Amid their respective situations, both girls begin playing the popular card game WIXOSS and discover that they have been chosen as Selectors—players whose memories are now represented by gold coins and must battle other Selectors to earn five of them.",
