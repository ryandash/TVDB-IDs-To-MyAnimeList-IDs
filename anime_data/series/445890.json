    "SummaryEnglish": "High schooler Minami Aoba has no strengths or aspirations and worries that she will live her life as a minor character—graduating as merely “Villager A.” So, she runs away from school in search of her uniqueness, her own “special something.” Unexpectedly, she has her first encounter with golf when she comes across a driving range and is approached by a part-timer and genius golfer Haruka Akane. Together with Haruka and influencer Ayaka Hoshimi, the unremarkable Minami becomes a super beginner ready to swing her golf club—aiming for the moment when she becomes the “Protagonist.”",
