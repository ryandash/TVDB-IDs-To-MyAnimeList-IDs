Nami's derisive remark and Kazane having created several designs for the wedding gown prompts Akiha to recruit Imoko into her plans to vote with her feet. Galvanized by the prospect of an amplified allowance, Nami gives chase and tries to scare capitulation into Akiha only to find that Imoko has already steered for the space port where Akiha finds that she cannot board the transport due to not having her student card, a minor but unexpected setback that stops the agoraphobic Nami in her tracks. Imoko and Akiha drive to the school with two of Akiha's classmates, one of which secures an escape pod for Akiha which she and Imoko avail after school only to be caught in the midst of a gravity quake, a gravity quake caused by the brain colony Leopard phasing in from hyperspace. Ahika exploring around on Leopard before meeting the AI entity face-to-face sets the stage for a frenzied Othello sequence that introduces Itsuki Kannagi (who tries to arrest both Akiha and Leopard), the QT-Arms Starsylph (which Akiha uses to arrest Leopard's ballistic plummet with Itsuki's guidance), and Honoka Kawai (who seems to have been awaiting Akiha's arrival along with Akiha's other siblings Takane and Sakura.",

Nami teases Akiha before running into Kazane who (after ordering Nami to her room) offers her apologies for the adverse side effects of her actions. It seems that the Student Council president wants to confront Akiha for her earlier adventure in the escape pod, a volition with which Honoka violently disagrees as she introduces herself in earnest. While Itsuki and Nina compute their next move regarding Leopard with UL, Honoka abducts Akiha and explains that she has an important role to fulfill for Leopard before leading her through equipping and defining the Q-TECTOR as the two set off on their first mission, replacing the magnetic chamber to Leopard's antimatter cannon. While Akiha grapples with the ethics, Honoka simply orders Wygar to destroy whatever precludes their travel path not caring that she brings the ICP into the mix by doing so. Directing that Akiha proceed on ahead, Honoka challenges Itsuki who soundly defeats her before confronting Akiha who is just about to emancipate the Golden Orb for transport, that is, if a clear trajectory can first be entreated of the newly-arrived Nervalist annelid.",

Honoka capitalizes upon Itsuki's decoy act and successfully wounds the annelid before helping Akiha transport the Golden Orb to Leopard in spite of Itsuki's injunction. Seeing the Nervalist annelid refuse to accept defeat as it orders the whole facility to give chase, Honoka stays behind and directs Akiha on ahead whose computations on interpreting the circumstances quickly takes a back seat to the converging ICP. The Golden Orb now in place, Leopard prepares to discharge his Golden Soul Shout; an effulgent explosion later, Leopard celebrating his victory with a haiku prompts Imoko to savagely remonstrate the AI entity and Akiha to repudiate Leopard much to Honoka's anguish. Meanwhile, Itsuki's decision to take matters into her own hands in spite of being read the riot act inspires the ICP powers-that-be to charge Bougainvillea and Mintao Itsuki's capture, the first attempt thereof blowing up in their face thanks to Itsuki's supervisor Nina. Even with her undercover alias Mutsumi Shimoyama, Itsuki demonstrates several times that she needs to be polished in several areas. Unfortunately, Honoka still sees the entire ICP as her enemy and decides to confront Itsuki by first luring her to the roof for a one-on-one duel. Shocked at the temerity behind Honoka's absolute neutrality injunction considering the damage caused thus far, Akiha intercedes with a \"Stop this at once!\" smack to both Honoka and Itsuki.",

While Itsuki is cautioned about Bougainvillea and Mintao, Leopard's web-surfing on her computer incenses Akiha enough to confront the AI and declare her autonomy only to have the mission objective reaffirmed, acquiring the Positron Matrix, before being sent on her way with Imoko. Meanwhile, Itsuki is summoned when a psychotic Nervalist iconoclast decides to wreak havoc only to find that she cannot even defend herself, never mind attacking him. Several members of the Student Council combining efforts with Honoka to stalemate and eventually neutralize the assailant sets the stage for a sequence that explains the common prologue both Honoka and Itsuki share with the Nervalists and the X-QT race, the latter having a near-complete computation crash as she tries to interpret all she has experienced while the ICP deals with the aftermath. Leopard reads Akiha finding the Positron Matrix right when Itsuki arrests her as the perfect opportunity to humble Akiha's recalcitrance by phasing away parts of her Q-TECTOR. Unfortunately, since Itsuki is in the same boat, that forces an armistice as Akiha and Itsuki collaborate to evacuate with some of their dignity and modesty unaware that Honoka has already successfully acquired the mission objective.",

Her anger at Leopard gone, Akiha sets to her daily school life and appears to be much happier. Honoka approaches Akiha with an entreaty to reconsider her repudiation that suggests that she has no independent human volition as she relays Akiha's inquiry of why Leopard chose her.

The deus ex machina comes when Leopard manifests himself and Honoka enters the fight to assist Itsuki. After Akiha has Starsylph embarrass Bougainvillea and Mintao before sending the two ninja flying, Leopard and Akiha's mutual interdependence on each other and Itsuki being a trustworthy ally are both confirmed quod erat demonstrandum.",

Because of the limited data and unknown resource requirements, Kazane directs Akiha and Imoko to school along with a promise from Takane to apprise of any new discoveries. While Honoka and Akiha change course to Leopard who is not thrilled with Sakura's attempts to entertain herself at his expense, it seems that there is something rotten in the Surre Academy Student Council as Aleida introduces Tsutsuji Baba to the AI entity Benkei along with there being quite a prologue between Aleida and Tsutsuji. As Benkei explains the Bisner Plan to Tsutsuji, Kazane manifests her displeasure at Akiha skipping school by lashing out at Nami who is incensed at being kept out of the loop with a stern \"Stop whining and grow up already!\" tirade before she and Takane make their exit. While out and about, Nami has a psychotic nervous breakdown related to her prologue as a model along with the anguish of being estranged from her family that sets the stage for her defection to Nerval whose volition for her is similar to that of Leopard for Akiha. The ICP powers-that-be wield Itsuki in a grudge match against Bougainvillea and Mintao who are following orders from the Shishido family to avail mirrors as bait to lure out Benkei who promptly phases into normal space.",

While Akiha and Imoko recover themselves, Takane and Honoka rush out to infiltrate Benkei whose argument with Leopard is an equal mix of Benkei's mirror theft attempts being repelled and rapier ripostes between both brain colonies. Tsutsuji's declaration of war against fate (aka Akiha herself) gives way to Itsuki joining the battle with Kazane's approval. Benkei encasing Leopard in an airtight matrix escalates matters to require the Leopard Cannon as well as the Absolute Break Through Control, both of which Benkei perverts to his advantage and Kirkwood's detriment. It seems that Tsutsuji initiating an energy signal that overrides autonomous human volition is part of Nerval's revenge from the St. Artemis battle, stalemating/subjugating Leopard, conquering the Shishido family, and arrogating Kirkwood. Furious at being wielded in Nerval's plans, Leopard recovers himself to push Benkei into a decaying orbit above Earth before ejecting himself. Takane, now a Nervalist vassal, wields her QT-ARMS to inhibit Akiha's collaborative efforts with Honoka and Itsuki to arrest Leopard's kamikaze plummet with Benkei.",

Honoka's dysphoric prologue is exhibited while Honoka easily dispenses with the situation and scolds Akiha for her weak heart before Sakura shows up to transport the trio along with Leopard to safety. Upon encountering an old man named Friedrich Otto Noblemain that uses a QT rose to entrap their craft for his own use, Honoka leaps into action to extinguish her dysphoric prologue.",
