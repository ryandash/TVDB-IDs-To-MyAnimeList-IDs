Takashiro has actually lived for more than 1000 years and was present since the start of the battle. He proceeds to tells Yuki that he was not related by blood to Yuki and that it was a lie to gain Yuki's initial trust. The reincarnation of the Zweilt guardians are also due to Takashiro summoning their souls back into the world in order to participate in the battle. Receiving empathy and understanding from Yuki who assures Takashiro that he remains an important person to him even if they do not possess blood ties, Takashiro brings Yuki to a monument which is known as God's Stone, the source of the Giou family's powers. There, he explains the origins of Reiga who was born from a union between a Giou-clan mother and an Opast father, making him a forbidden child. Reiga's main intent is to destroy humans as he views them as not fit to live. Takashiro mentions that Reiga who was reincarnated as Kanata holds no memory of his past self before his awakening, assuring Yuki that the Kanata he has spent his childhood with is not a set up facade.

The Giou clan was a well-known family who directly served the court and was led by 4 high-ranking personages: Ario, Takashiro, Reiga and a girl named Yomi. Reiga was feared and shunned due to his mixed parentage but he was supported by both Takashiro and Yomi. They lived in relative peace until a summons came from the royal court for the Giou clan to exterminate some high-ranking demons that were accidentally summoned. Takashiro accepted the task and set off from the village, leaving Reiga and Yomi in-charge of defending the village. Before he left, however, he remarked that he would be back to witness the blossoming of the lone sakura tree (representing Reiga) which had not put forth flowers for a long time. The demon-exterminating task took Takashiro longer than he initially thought and as he rode back, he noticed a great fire devastating the village. Hearing from an injured villager that Reiga had disarmed the barrier that protects the village, allowing a horde of monsters to assault the place, he ran to Yomi's room but found her dead. He received the scar on his face as Reiga directed a beam of light while Takashiro attempted to rush to Yomi's side. As Takashiro questioned Reiga as to his motive for burning the village, Reiga remarks that \"everything is already too late\" before disappearing. Yuki, after learning of the event that ignited the battle, decides to continue participating in it to stop others from getting hurt. It is also revealed that Ibuki and Tsubaki are his aunts; them being his mother, Mizuki's younger sisters. Handing over a picture of Mizuki to Yuki, they reassure him that his birth was not meaningless as he is loved and wanted. It was unknown, however, why Mizuki withheld the name of her husband from her sisters and also the reason Yuki was left at the orphanage.",

She tries to persuade Luka to return to the Duras' side but is rejected. A brief fight ensues with Luka easily disarming Elegy, most probably because she refuses to use her full power. As he is about to deal the finishing blow, a figure appears before him: the female Yuki from the past. Luka is stunned to see her and lowers his guard, embracing her as she repeatedly tells him that she loves him. The figure proved to be an illusion when Tsukumo injures Elegy with a shot from his gun and both he and Touko run up to Luka to provide back-up. Elegy, outnumbered, retreats. On the other side of the forest, Yuki is rushed back to the mansion by Senshiro and Kuroto after they sensed Elegy while searching for Luka.

Breaking the chains easily, Cadenza turns on his master as befit his title \"Master Killer\" and they exchange blows.

However, Reiga mentions that it was just his plan not to kill Yuki so early in the battle and reiterates the fact that Kanata is now gone. As Yuki continues to deny Reiga's words, Cadenza finally asks Reiga where his loyalties lie.",
