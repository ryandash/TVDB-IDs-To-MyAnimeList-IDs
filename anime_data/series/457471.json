With Hiwamura's weak voice, weak stamina, and basically weak in every aspect, one might have the urge to protect her. Ironically, students misread her meekness and fear her as the rumored \"Ms. Scary\" who will curse them if she gets upset. Nevertheless, she works hard for her students, and one student, Akihito Abikura, recognizes her true nature.",
