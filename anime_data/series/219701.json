Ganessa reveals to Kazuya that a year ago during an outdoor training session, Ingrid's best friend Marina died when she fought a Nova alone, and she believes Marina would have survived had the younger students not run away due to a lack of discipline in their ranks. Hearing this, Kazuya freezes Ingrid and tells her that he understands her pain just like he had when he lost his sister. He tells her her actions are tainting her late friend's memories, that Marina didn't die in vain as she was actually sacrificing her life to protect the younger students.
