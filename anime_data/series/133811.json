As could be predicted from the acclivity course, Pollyanna is not prepared for the subsequent declivity at whose nadir grows a group of flowers that helps to mitigate the damage from the rough landing; an impromptu tribute offering to Pollyanna's late mother Jennie gives way to Pollyanna's father Pastor John Whittier summoning his daughter for breakfast complete with an innovative example of his chosen style of family government. The itinerary for the day has as its central feature the Pastor presiding over a meeting of the community group known as Ladies' Aid over a budgetary matter -- if the Pastor's thrombosis will behave for the duration of the meeting; thinking that she can help ensure smooth sailing, Pollyanna decides to peer in on the meeting only to find that one of the Lady Aides is not keen on live audiences!!! Pollyanna races off to rendezvous with her best friend Karen -- and into a lengthy harangue courtesy of Mrs. White that starts with the eavesdropping and deteriorates into a marital dispute of random destructive criticism that ultimately cares nothing of Pollyanna's concern for the Pastor's health nor the ice cream with which Mr. White greets Pollyanna; later that evening, the Pastor interjects his perspective on Pollyanna's frustration and has his daughter's greatest anxiety visited unto him.",

Karen recounting how she recovered from a cold much faster when she had access to her favorite food prompts Pollyanna to prosecute that very enterprise much to the anxious dismay of the Pastor and Mrs. White as there is a man-eating bear in the forest whose ravenous chase drives the two girls over a cliff to a ledge where the requisite strawberries are growing; the endemic parental scolding resolved, the dangerous gambit pays off when the Pastor's condition starts to improve. Pollyanna's courage and the Pastor's appreciation thereof is ultimately cold comfort to the whole episode of protracted downtime having driven home the proximity of the Pastor's depot destination when a black dress is discovered among the donated clothes; sure enough, the Pastor's coronary calamity has progressed to the point where the Pastor has just enough time to have Mr. White initiate his final arrangements and impart his concluding counsel for Pollyanna prior to his expiration.",

Fortunately for Pollyanna, Polly does have some honorable compassion that is slightly greater than her volition for the perpetuation of the long-standing quiescent homeostasis as she replies for housing Pollyanna after having Nancy prepare a room in the attic. Galvanized by the data of having an aunt that is willing to take her in, Pollyanna has a dangerous opportunity before her with hefty stakes as she ultimately has to compute whether to stay or go; while Mr. and Mrs. White are both willing to support her either way, Pollyanna just might end up having bought a pig in a poke once she arrives in B",

Elated at Jimmy's agreement to aid in the search, Pollyanna remembers that the hill visible from her attic bedroom has many parallels to the hill in her former hometown; therefore, if Chipmunk has made that very conclusion, he will probably be sulking there.

Already quite frustrated at how Polly's heartlessness is necessitating the whole hullabaloo and seeing that there will be no winners regardless of whether anybody challenges Pollyanna's bedside vigil as Chipmunk recuperates outside, Nancy ultimately decides to go for broke in one final bid to get Polly to see reason; Chipmunk now safely indoors, Pollyanna rushing in to visit her gratitude unto Polly ignites some memories that the aristocrat has been repressed over the previous decade of solitude that are really precious.",

Even with the immense community support from the entire town of Beldingsville, Harrington-ke still finds it a hefty challenge to ultimately get its groove back when Tom secludes himself in the barn with Coney while Pollyanna desperately but unsuccessfully tries to compute something for Polly to be glad about; upon Della's return to Boston, Wetherby-ke is not slow in concluding that Harrington-ke needs an externally-interjected catalyst to conquer its anguish once James signals an interest in going to Beldingsville much to Pollyanna's delight -- if one overlooks how clumsily she delivers Jimmy the news.",

Timothy becomes infatuated with Ruth as he sets to retrieving their payload and loading it on the carriage prior to initiating the home commute that becomes the forum for James to marvel at the scenery and for Pollyanna to relive when she herself was the newcomer to Beldingsville a year ago before recounting how she lost her father along with Mr. Pendleton's counsel to her. Upon arriving at Harrington-ke, Pollyanna is anguished at how despondent Polly is behaving upon encouraging Ruth and James to rest from their journey before secluding herself again; while Ruth and James are settling in, Nancy fulminates Timothy's uxorious sycophancy which Durgin prefers to Tom's guilt at not having been able to rescue Dr. Chilton any earlier than he did.

Even with Pollyanna buying his impromptu damage control and setting her sights on guiding James through downtown Beldingsville, Timothy ultimately finds that imparting a sorely-needed jolt of insight to his father is better suited to eloquent politics than authentic performance -- the latter of which requires a trip down memory lane catalyzed by an equally-anguished Jimmy; while successful in bootstrapping Tom back into action, Jimmy is still hostile to the idea of spending time with James.",

What Pollyanna is anguished to learn is that there are times when success has consequences that are ultimately worse than those of failure; if Ruth locates her nephew Jaime Kent, there is a real possibility that James will indefinitely remain stuck with a defunct power-train -- a prospect that gets a huge shot in the arm when Mr. Pendleton drags Jimmy along in his bid to court Ruth!!!",
