                    "SummaryEnglish": "The movie version of Galaxy Express 999, released in 1979, serves as a compression of the storyline told in the manga and television series with some modifications. Maetel and Tetsuro again set out for the home planet of the Mechanized Empire, but rather than visiting over a hundred planets, as in the original manga/TV series, Tetsuro only visits four—Titan, Pluto, Heavy Melder, and Planet Maetel. Like Planet Prometheum, Planet Maetel is a mechanized world where machine bodies are made. It is implied that Planet Maetel had once been Maetel's machine body—just as the planet Great Andromeda serves as the machine body of her mother's consciousness in the sequel film, Adieu Galaxy Express 999 -- and is still somehow linked to her. Maetel says of the planet, \"This planet is also me. It is half of my own heart. We're different, but both are myself.\"",

Mother Computer Junior, discovered their escape and had them executed, while restoring Tetsuro and Maetel to their original size.",

Unexpectedly, a duplicate 999 materializes alongside them and the two trains collide and become entangled. Crippled, the 999 and its double are drawn into the gravity of a sinister-looking planet that seems to be adrift in Warp Space. Tetsuro climbs though a breach into the other 999 and encounters an exact double of Maetel; however her companion is not his own double, but a different boy named Redril Hammer. Redril explains that he is traveling on the 999 to a planet where he will receive a mechanical body for free. The trains narrowly avert crashing down but the car carrying both Maetels breaks loose and falls to the surface.",

When the aliens confirm to their satisfaction that Tetsuro, Redril, the two Maetels and the two Conductors are flesh-and-blood and not mechanized, they are permitted to return to the trains. As they prepare to lift off, the Conductors are seized by a pair of mechanical creatures with a shape resembling that of the two \"humans\" they encountered before.

The young man broke into their hotel room stole Tetsuro's belongings, including his pass, so that he could board the 999 disguised as Tetsuro.

Once on the surface, Tetsuro and Maetel were escorted by Mirai, who brought them to the sanitarium where Tetsuro had up to 24 hours to contemplate his decision on adopting a mechanical body. Maetel warned Tetsuro to think wisely before leaving him with Mirai to meet her father, whose consciousness was encased in a pendant. In the sanitarium, Tetsuro realized that the life of a cyborg was empty and disappointing, and decided not to take his machine body. He also witnessed a cyborg committing suicide and, in his last moments, warned Tetsuro of Maetel's intentions, and that she was the daughter of the Queen of Promethium. In a confrontation between Tetsuro and Maetel, Mirai explained that Maetel was to bring courageous young boys like him to help construct an eternal mechanized empire.",

In the mean time, Maetel was able to escape, and managed to turn off the tractor beams. The 999 was able to change course and returned to the planet to save Maetel. He ran into Mirai, and stopped her trying to kill herself for failing to persuade Tetsuro to become a cyborg. Maetel appeared, and the three agreed to work together to retrieve the pendant from the Queen. Though this time the plan successful and the reactor began to overload, Mirai was killed in the process. Queen Promethium disintegrated (but presumably not killed) in the final confrontation with Maetel and Tetsuro.",
