This isn`t like you.\" Kanade throws him by reflex, then Shikijou flies into a rage and turns a stun gun on her!\r\n\r\nWhen Kanade slowly regains consciousness, she finds herself in a dimly lit abandoned warehouse where a group of delinquents are chatting and laughing. Kanade`s hands and feet are tied with rope, so she can`t move. Shikijou moves closer to her saying, \"Kanade-san, you aren`t normal right now. We have to reform you.\"",
