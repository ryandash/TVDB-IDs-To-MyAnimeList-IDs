One night, after stopping at the town of Pasroe, he finds in his wagon what appears to be a normal 15 year old girl, except for a wolf's tail and ears. She introduces herself as a 600 year old pagan wolf deity named Holo, the town's goddess of harvest who has kept it blessed with good harvests for many years. Despite her ancient pact to watch over the town, she now wants to go back to her homeland as she believes the people have already forsaken her. She manages to bargain her way out of the village by making a deal with Lawrence to take her with him. As they travel, her wisdom helps increase his profits, but at the same time, her true nature draws unwanted attention from the church.",
