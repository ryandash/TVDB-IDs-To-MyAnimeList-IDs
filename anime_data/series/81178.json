    "SummaryEnglish": "Kraft Lawrence is a 25 year old merchant traveling around a land reminiscent of medieval Europe. One night, after stopping at the town of Pasroe, he finds in his wagon what appears to be a normal 15 year old girl, except for a wolf's tail and ears. She introduces herself as a 600 year old pagan wolf deity named Holo, the town's goddess of harvest who has kept it blessed with good harvests for many years. Despite her ancient pact to watch over the town, she now wants to go back to her homeland as she believes the people have already forsaken her. She manages to bargain her way out of the village by making a deal with Lawrence to take her with him. As they travel, her wisdom helps increase his profits, but at the same time, her true nature draws unwanted attention from the church.",

After receiving the information on Amati's assets, Lawrence finds Amati and proposes a deal based on credit (essentially, a naked short on pyrite), which will result in profit for Amati if the price of pyrite rises or losses if the price of pyrite falls. Amati accepts the deal after Lawrence appeals to his chivalry and causes him to doubt that Holo will agree to his marriage proposal. Unable to enlist Mark's help to purchase the pyrite necessary to pull off the deal, Lawrence turns to the alchemists in the belief that they should have a large amount of pyrite that he can purchase.",
