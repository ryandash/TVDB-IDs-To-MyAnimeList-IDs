The attacks fail, however, as Mazinger Z is revealed to have been made from Super Alloy Z, allowing him to absorb the blast.

Kouji, Shiro, and Ankokuji's rejoicing is short lived, however, as Juuzou dies moments afterwords.

Ashura then escapes Mazinger's grasp, causing Kouji to let loose another Breast Fire attack, which Sayaka blocks using Aphrodai A. As Sayaka, and her father, Prof. Yumi, help Kouji to calm down, the plane carrying Prof. Yumi is destroyed by a new enemy: The headless Count Brocken, who deploys the bomber-robot Groizer X-10 to destroy Mazinger, and the rest of Atami. As the Mazinger Corps. fail to hold off Groizer's decent, Kouji and the others are faced with no escape. Suddenly, Tsubasa Nishikiori walks out towards Mazinger Z, telling Kouji that there is one weapon which he can still use: The Photon Beam.",

Meanwhile, Sayaka and the Mazinger Corp. have returned to the Photon Research Facility, and consider the sheer power of Mazinger Z, reflecting on Kouji's outburst the night before. Dr. Hell, Count Brocken, and Baron Ashura also reflect upon their previous defeat while on board the Flying Fortress, Ghoul. Later, Prof. Yumi tells Sayaka of his early work with Dr. Kabuto: Their discovery of Japanium, Juuzou's sudden disappearance, and the fact that he, in truth, chose to perform the Photon Energy tests in Atami in order to lure Dr. Kabuto out, so that they could complete their research together. Amidst these discussions, the story flashes back to the night before, continuing from the end of the previous episode, as Nishikiori tells Kouji to fire the Photon Beam. As Brocken's Groizer X-10 approaches, it begins to drop bombs on Atami, while Nishikiori instructs Kouji on how to operate the beam. With only moments before impact, Kouji charges the beam to its maximum capacity, and fires at Groizer, propelling it back into the air, and destroying it completely. Returning to the day afterwords, Sayaka and her father visit the Shirogane house, where Nishikiori explains her connection to Dr. Kabuto. Moments later, however, police officers sent by Ankokuji arrive, with a search warrant to look for the missing Pilder (which had vanished after the battle the night before). At the same time, Ankokuji demands that Kouji tell him where he hid the Pilder, while Kouji insists that he does not know.

As a pair officers slowly approach the office to fetch Shiro, he overhears their plan, and is forced to hide, causing Ankokuji to send even more officers out to search for him. In the midst of all of this, Prof. Yumi and Sayaka become suspicious of Ankokuji's entire operation, noticing that the number of officers out searching for the Pilder far exceed those that would normally be present in Atami, and dispatches Sayaka in Aphrodai A.

Currently locked inside is Aphrodai A, the result of their confrontation in episode 7. As Ashura escapes and orders Nonakargo to capture Mazinger Z, Tsubasa tells Yasu to send out \"the signal\" in the form of a firework. This signal turns out to be the command to summon the Pilder, which was actually hidden underneath the Kurogane house, sending it (and Ankokuji, who fell on top) flying towards Kouji's location. Meanwhile, Boss and his cohorts who were originally planning to steal Mazinger Z decide to flee, since Nonakargo is approaching them. However, they're stopped by a strange new character in a sombrero, who is revealed to be another member of the Kurogane House - the sharpshooter Django. Django forces Boss and his group to help him fight the approaching Nonakargo on foot, by entrenching themselves in Mazinger Z's head and firing on it with a large rifle. The rifle turns out to fire special ice rounds, which freeze Nonakargo in place. Having bought themselves some time, Tsubasa and Kouji pursue Baron Ashura in the Pilder. It is then that Baron Ashura's origins were revealed - during the excavation of Bardos Island, Juzo and Dr. Hell discovered two lovers preserved within a cocoon, who Dr. Hell suggests should be revived from the dead to tell them the secrets of Bardos Island. Juzo points out that since half of the lover's bodies were decayed, they'd be impossible to revive - to which Dr. Hell suggests they be reborn as the same person. With his assistant Tsubasa's help, they successfully sew together the two lovers and bring them to life. Unfortunately, Ashura is immediately hostile to everyone in the room. To prevent this in the future, Tsubasa performs another surgery that will shock Ashura should he/she try to attack her or Dr. Hell - this is the source of her powers in the previou",
