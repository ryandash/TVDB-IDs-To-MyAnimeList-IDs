With Kakashi wondering why Tobi would bluff as the Eight and Nine-Tails' chakra are still intact, Gyūki notes that Tobi may have got his chakra from the clone he created to cover Killer Bee's escape from Taka. Kurama also adds that his chakra is present in the treasured tools, which contain the sealed Gold and Silver Brothers, that the Gedo Statue swallowed earlier. Though the allied ninja all agree that its resurrection must be stopped, Tobi declares that even if an incompletely revived Ten Tails would still ensure the achievement of the Infinite Tsukuyomi. As the group rally to fight, Naruto enters his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode and proceeds to attack the statue.",

As Tobi is distracted, Kakashi attempts to use Kamui on the Gedo Statue before it was suddenly nullified to his confusion. By then, Naruto fails to land his attack as Tobi separates him from the others to get the upper hand. Rushing to Naruto's aid, Kakashi launches his lightning-imbued kunai at Tobi before forced to warp the kunai away when the villain changes its trajectory towards Naruto. However, Tobi finds a slight fissure appearing on his mask that the others notice as he erects a barrier around the Gedo Statue to hinder Gyūki. Analyzing the masked man's abilities, Kakashi asks the group to aid him in testing his theory to confirm that Tobi has been using one technique the entire time in this fight: the exact same Kamui as himself. When asked where he got his Sharingan from, Tobi upsets Kakashi by claiming to obtained it while from battle at the Kannabi Bridge. As Tobi states there is no more hope for the world, Naruto rejects his views and Kurama — who briefly takes over his Jinchuriki's body — declares that Minato sealed him within Naruto to give the youth the power to take him down. With that as he gives the youth back his body, the Nine-Tails tells Naruto to charge Tobi head on.",

Meanwhile, a hesitant Kakashi is in disbelief of the masked man's identity but Guy snaps him out of it. As the battle rages on, Kakashi is finally motivated to fight and prepares to join the fray. Tobi unleashes a shower of gigantic chakra receivers, paralyzing B and Gyūki. Naruto creates a shadow clone and it charges forward with Rasengan while the original prepares a Tailed Beast Ball with B and Gyūki acting as a shield. As Naruto launches his technique, Tobi simply phases through and with that, fully enters the other dimension. There, he witnesses the clone earlier and realizes that Kakashi did not just teleport the Rasengan but the clone itself. With little time to react, Tobi curses Kakashi before he is hit by Naruto's Rasengan; his mask shattered into pieces. Watching on, Kakashi and Guy are shocked to see that the masked man is their former comrade, Obito Uchiha who as a child had dreams of becoming the Hokage but who would never beat Kakashi or Guy. During his time at the Academy, Obito was later placed into a team consisting of himself, Kakashi and a young girl named Rin Nohara with the team being led by Naruto's father, Minato Namikaze. Obito had romantic feelings for Rin who actually loved Kakashi which in turn fueled Obito's desire to defeat Kakashi. However, Obito was left badly injured following a mission in which a boulder crushed the right side of his body. Believing himself to be on the verge of death, Obito gave Kakashi the Sharigan from Obito's own left eye which served as a replacement for Kakashi's left eye which had been left permanently scarred and damaged during a fight against a lone rogue ninja. When more ninja assaulted the cave, Kakashi and Rin were able to escape with Obito being engulfed by the landslide. In the present, rendered speechless, Kakashi is shocked that Obito survived.

Madara, however, blocks the attack and defeats the clone. Then, he manages to capture the Eight and the Nine-Tails. Kakashi uses this opportunity to question his old friend about what happened to him and Obito remember about when he attacked Konoha and confronted by his former sensei, also making him have a flashback of his first encounter with his team and then states that he no longer cared about this world. Meanwhile, Naruto declares to Madara that he was Fourth Hokage's son and would not be overpowered by him. Madara then creates an enormous wood dragon, which he notes had been used by Hashirama Senju in the past to bind the Nine-Tails. This forces Naruto to use Tailed Beast Mode to fight it. Kakashi continues to ask Obito why he chose to follow someone like Madara, but the Uchiha notes that he had nothing left to say to him and that this is their final fight. Continuing their battle, Obito leaves an attack with many shuriken, but is stopped by Kakashi's wall of earth. As Obito slips through the wall, Kakashi continues to ask him if the reason was related to Rin, to which Obito sharply retorts telling \"this scum\" to shut up. Obito then warps Kakashi to the other dimension, but Kakashi soon returns with the same technique. In the meantime, the Wood Dragon begins absorbing Kurama's chakra, causing Naruto on the verge of breakdown. The legendary Uchiha also uses Wood Release to bind Killer B and Might Guy, then begins to activate his Susanoo to finish things up on the battlefield. Disregarding this, Naruto notes that the Uchiha's ideals annoyed him and, by creating a shadow clone, he is able to stop both Obito's shuriken and Madara's Susanoo Sword from killing Kakashi, Guy and Gyūki respectively. Hearing Naruto's words that he would protect his friends, Kakashi and Guy both spring into action with the former using Lightning Cutter to dest",

Madara and Obito take command of the Ten-Tails, and discuss whether they should move their plans along or test its power. Kurama develops a strategy against the Ten-Tails, resulting in a gamble with a Kakashi releasing B from Kamui's dimension right in front of the beast to target its eye, but it simply flicks the Tailed Beast Ball right back at B. Running low on chakra, B and Naruto revert from their Tailed Beast Modes. Naruto moves in to create more shadow clones, but ends up discussing ideals with Obito. Obito has the Ten-Tails fire a Tailed Beast Ball at them, which misses due to the timely arrival and intervention of Ino, Hinata, and a few others. Several Aburame and Kirigakure shinobi disrupt sensing and conceal the battlefield. The rest of the Allied Shinobi Forces arrives at the battlefield, revealed as the Ten-Tails swipes its tail to blow away their cover. Naruto boldly claims that the Allied Shinobi Forces Technique is more powerful than the Infinite Tsukuyomi. Remaining unimpressed by their swollen numbers, Obito argues with Naruto some more, during which time Shikaku relays the Alliance a strategy through Inoichi's telepathy. The Alliance sequentially blinds the Ten-Tails, sinks it into the ground, and binds it with a quick-drying mixture of water and quicklime. Madara notes the good coordination from shinobi from different countries. Shikaku instructs the Alliance to cooperate with Naruto in exploiting the limits of Obito's intangibility, and taijutsu-capable shinobi to attack Madara. As their assault begins, Obito and Madara note that they cling to hope that doesn't exist as the Ten-Tails begins changing.",

Realizing the inevitable, Shikaku has Inoichi relay one final plan to the Alliance in order to stop Madara and Obito, before the HQ is annihilated. Afterwards, Madara outlines his plan to become the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki to Obito, before the latter has the Ten-Tails launch a barrage of wooden spikes at the Alliance, killing countless more shinobi, and also resulting in Neji receiving a fatal wound after defending Naruto. As Neji dies in Naruto's arms, Obito uses the opportunity to demoralize Naruto. However, Hinata with support from Kurama steps in and boosts Naruto's morale. Afterwards, Obito recklessly launches a close-ranged Tailed-Beast Ball, which is repelled by the recovered Bee. Finally, drawing strength from the bonds he has made, Naruto prepares for a counterattack whilst infusing Hinata with Kurama's chakra.",
