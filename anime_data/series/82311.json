                    "SummaryEnglish": "Ryōta dreams of a scene from his past involving a promise of marriage between him and Chika before waking up late and dashing to school. However, his euphoric morning is quickly extinguished when Yūki spreads the news of Chika having dreamt that same morning of a promise she made to Ryouta after he wet the bed when in kindergarten. Ryōta lashes out at Kazumi pitying him for wetting his bed under the impression that everyone was talking about Chika remembering their promise to marry each other only to realize his mistake when Chika apologizes to him the next day. Ryouta begins to sulk until Chika approaching him alone at the end of the school day to cheer him up causes him to recall the other promise that he made with Chika after wetting his bed in kindergarten: to try his best to become a better man. Ryouta catching Chika as she is about to lose her balance while changing her shoes signals his decision to forgive her. Back from winter vacation, Chika begins wearing the hairpins that Ryōta gave her as present.",
