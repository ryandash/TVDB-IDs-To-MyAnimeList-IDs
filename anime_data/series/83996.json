The scene then cuts to the present, where the triplet servants continue their fight against Sebastian, in which they are defeated. Meanwhile back at the party, the ball is in full swing. Suddenly, Hannah arrives, carting a strange instrument (later called an armonica) that she plays for the guests. Though the guests are at first memorized, the tune starts to harm them physically. Outside, another fight erupts between the triplet servants and Sebastian. Hannah's music has taken control of the majority of the guests and have turned them into hostile, weapon-toting zombies. While Ranmao and Lau have corks in their ears, Agni assists Prince Soma and his friends to retain control of themselves while fending off the controlled guests. Eventually, the haunting tune reaches the outside, and after Sebastian frightens the triplet servants off for good, he rushes towards the castle with Ciel in his arms. Just as Soma is overwhelmed by the hostile crowd, Sebastian arrives to counter Hannah's melody with his own produced by water-filled glasses. As the armonica shatters, the guests are completely freed and applaud Sebastian's performance. Alois and Claude take this chance to make an entrance, and soon after, Sebastian and Claude agree to have a private conversation. On a lake, Sebastian and Claude duke it out, and during their squabble, it is revealed that Sebastian could not devour Ciel's soul because he had \"become a void\". It appears Claude somehow snatched Ciel's soul before Sebastian, but could not use it due to it being \"incomplete.\" They strike up a deal afterward in which Alois Trancy will be the new target of Ciel's revenge, and form a contract by dripping their blood into the petals of two roses. Elsewhere, Elizabeth is forced into a dance with Alois, so Ciel joins the dan",

Ciel initially rejects the invitation, but after discovering some clues pertaining to the murder of his parents, he decides to pay Alois a visit, though only for the purpose of killing him. At the Trancy Estate, Alois has already prepared an enormous chessboard for Sebastian, Claude, the triple servants, and Hanna to battle on while the two young lords observe from afar. Before they can begin, Viscount Druitt appears for the costume ball, but he is a week late. So, he chooses to watch the fight with Ciel and Alois. The triple servants try to take down Sebastian first, but they are easily defeated after Sebastian impales their heads with a spear. Next is Hannah, who also fails after her bullets are unable to so much as graze the Phantomhive butler. Claude stops Sebastian from making another move, as it is tea time for their masters. After a short food fight between Claude and Sebastian, the two serve desserts to their lords and Druitt, who needs the restroom after fawning over both snacks. After the break, Claude and Sebastian resume their \"dance.\" Claude retrieves a strange blade, the Laevatein, from Hanna's stomach and begins to attack Sebastian at full throttle. Meanwhile, Ciel asks Alois to take him inside the mansion for a brief tour, but once they're inside, he challenges Alois to a duel. Following Ciel's unsuccessful attempts to decapitate Alois, Alois gains the upper hand by pushing Ciel from the second story to the ground floor. Just as he intends to finish Ciel off, Ciel grabs Alois's blade. The two butlers outside hear the clang of swords, drop the fight, and track down their lords. However, they are too late. Ciel has stabbed Alois in the side, causing the latter to writhe on the floor. Ciel prepares to finish Alois despite his claims of also losing his parents and pleas for mercy, but is stopped by Claude. Ciel slaps Claude for this, which causes some of his blood to stick to Claude's face.",

When Alois refuses to let Hannah change his bandages, Claude comes in to do so. Alois asks Claude if he is enticed by the blood and Claude admits his desire to devour Alois and smiles for the first time, which disturbs Alois. Later, Alois interrupts Hannah as she is cleaning, crying on top of her and ordering her to take him to Ciel Phantomhive. In a separate room, Claude neatly folds a document into a ring after the triplet servants whisper something into his ear. The scene shifts to Hannah driving a carriage with a bleeding Alois inside. In his flashback, it appears Alois's real name is Jim McCain and the red-haired boy (shown in the first episode) is his little brother, Luca. Alois confesses to his younger brother that he wishes the villagers would die because of how they were treated after becoming orphans. Believing his brother has the power to accomplish such a thing, Luca declares, \"Yes, Your Highness.\" That night, they discover all the inhabitants of the village are dead, which causes Alois to erupt in a delirious joy. Luca is initially happy with him, but seems concerned. Together, they raid the dead for their personal belongings. After a while, Alois feels a chill and decides it's time to leave. He goes on a search for his brother only to find him dead. He then screams with anguish saying that he doesn't want to be alone. Years later, Alois and some other boys are brought to Lord Trancy, a pedophile. After being rejected by Trancy, Alois overhears a method to summon a wish-granting fairy, but instead of a fairy, Alois encounters Claude, but is unable to think of a wish. Alois uses his sex appeal to win over Trancy, and presumably some time after that, he makes a contract with Claude. In the present, the carriage crashes and Grell arrives to take Alois' soul.

He explains that Ciel and Alois are more alike than they appear, which he plans to use to his advantage. At the Phantomhive estate, Sebastian receives an order from the Queen, in which Ciel must solve another case. During the carriage ride to the victim's house, Ciel recalls his battle with Alois and how he said both of them are alike - this memory seems to disturb him. Ciel asks Sebastian if he's hiding anything from him regarding Alois Trancy, but Sebastian insists that he has not. The victim, a poor boy, states that a strange, rich boy had gouged out his eyes. Sebastian and Ciel are attacked before they can return to the carriage, so Sebastian asks Ciel to remain concealed in a crate. Ciel feels that he has forgotten things and slowly begins to recollect the time Sebastian had put him in a trunk and told him to stay there. This bothers him so much, he bursts from the crate and flees the scene. Meanwhile, Sebastian battles William Spears and Ronald Knox, who are still investigating Alois's soul. Sebastian eventually escapes. In another part of town, Ciel is framed for the crime he's investigating as Hannah tells the police he is a mentally ill, hostile Alois Trancy. Despite Ciel's protests, he is taken to psychiatric doctors who try to rid him of his \"confusion\" through torture. These doctors are later killed by Claude, who steps in as Ciel's psychiatrist. Using the shock induced by torture, hypnosis, and Alois's ring that contains his soul, Claude reveals that Luca had made a contract with Sebastian to burn the village and combines the memories of Alois and Ciel. They resemble each other so well (\"deep blue to midnight blue\"), Ciel believes it was Sebastian who killed his parents. After Sebastian defeats Hannah, who served as a diversion, he arrives to discover an enraged Ciel. Upon Claude's intervention, Ciel commands Sebastian to disappear from his sight. Claude then ta",

He becomes increasingly perturbed as Claude basks in many of Ciel's favorable qualities. In the manor, Claude follows Ciel's every order to please him, but he only succeeds in annoying him. Claude attempts to convince Ciel to break his contract with Sebastian and forge a new one with him as his servant, but Ciel quickly refuses. Claude encounters Sebastian outside the manor, and reminds him that per his master's order, he cannot be seen by Ciel. Sebastian sees Grell and persuades him to help gather information about Luca and the village he and his demon destroyed, Arachnophile. There, an ex-prostitute informs them of the carnage she witnessed at the hands of Luca - only she was spared due to the kindness she showed him. Before she can explain further, she is killed by the triplet servants, who immediately engage Sebastian in combat. Sebastian easily defeats them and binds them upside-down to a tree, and Grell finishes them off with his death scythe. As Grell slices into the three, their cinematic record plays, showing they were present during the great fire that destroyed Arachnophile. The record also shows Ciel helping Hannah stand after he accidentally hit her with his cane, which aggravates Sebastian to the point that he sprints back to the Trancy estate, leaving Grell to follow him. Back at the mansion, Ciel has broken a mirror, under the impression he saw Alois's reflection. At first, Claude assigns Hannah to clean up the mess while Claude returns Ciel to his room, but Ciel then orders Claude to clean the mess in Hannah's place. In his bedchamber, Ciel laments to Hannah that he wishes to return to his own mansion. As he notes the \"mysterious\" color of Hannah's remaining eye, she abruptly tells him to look into her mouth, which opens to reveal a gaping abyss. Within, Alois's eye squirms and stares back.

Hannah explains that Ciel's body has been taken over by Alois, and that she will have them journey through the maze made by Alois. Ciel realizes he has been taken over and sifts through the memories in his head to decide which ones are his. The butlers begin their journey through the maze, and soon realize that the answers to the questions are being altered by Alois(and that he has given Claude a handicap). Grell arrives to help Sebastian after he gets a wrong answer, while Alois scratches frantically at Ciel's body. Ciel begins to remember some events of last season, and Alois notes that Ciel is struggling to get back control of his body. As Ciel remembers that his revenge is complete, the maze begins to shift. Ciel begins to question why Sebastian did not eat his soul, so it appears as a question in the maze. Sebastian was unable to eat Ciel's because he lost the arm with the seal of the contract on it, which provided a window of opportunity for Claude to steal Ciel's soul. Claude reaches the place of the final question: why did Claude kill Alois? Claude answers that he killed him because he could ultimately be used as a tool to obtain Ciel. That isn't the answer Alois wants to hear, so he drops Claude down a chute. Alois begins to cry but Hannah tells him that he shouldn't cry, and that Big Brother is always the best, something Luca used to say. Claude reveals in his answer to a question that it was actually Hannah who contracted with Luca. Hannah confirms it and said she had grown tired of eating human souls, as they had become boring. She tells him that Luca was different, and that when she fulfilled his wish, he thanked her for killing the townspeople, something no one had ever done. Hannah, very attached to Luca and Alois, asks Alois to make a new contract with her, to be reunited with Luca. Claude and Sebastian reunite at the place of the final question, and Ciel takes over",

Hannah says that both Sebastian and Claude will fight a true Demon's Duel for the right to claim Ciel's soul. After removing the Demon Blade from her body, Hannah places the sword in a cave and the two demon butlers begin their duel. Both butlers take the sword back and forth between them but neither manages to make a fatal blow. Sebastian, feeling confined by the cave, uses the sword to split the island in half creating a large fissure in the ground. In limbo, Ciel and Alois comment on the fight, with Ciel saying Alois doesn't understand Sebastian's motivations. Alois concedes the point, and apologizes for using Ciel for his own purposes. The battle appears to be a stalemate until Claude lands on a rock that gives way under him, causing him to lose his balance. The momentary distraction allows Sebastian to plunge the Demon Blade through Claude's body. Sebastian comments that Alois has been 'playing' with Claude all this time and he never realized it. As he dies, Claude comments that Alois managed to make a 'small ripple' in the long, boring life of a demon, so perhaps Alois's soul was more precious than he thought. Hannah sheds tears of joy and reveals that the contract Alois made with Hannah was to get Claude to acknowledge him. Sebastian comes for Ciel, but Hannah falls to the ocean below with him speaking unheard words that shock Sebastian. He dives in after Ciel and after reaching him, he kills Ciel just as he awakens. Back on the island, Hannah lies down with Claude's body, saying that she, Claude, Alois, and his brother can now all be together. Some time later, Ciel awakens in bed with Sebastian preparing him tea. As Ciel is dressed by Sebastian, his eye takes on a demon glow. It is revealed that as a condition of Alois's wish being fulfilled, Alois asked that Hannah makes Ciel's soul unattainable by either Sebastain or Claude.
