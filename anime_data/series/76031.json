Along the way she is stopped by Kilnorton, who pleads with her to make him love glasses again so he will go help the others fight.

He then proceeds to take out everyone else. Once they are gone, only Ai remains. Anon picks her up and walks her over to a cliff, choking her all the way. While doing this he explains why he has done what he has done. As a protector, he never understood happiness. Then one day he started believing that happiness was a path devoid of hindrances, and that meant destroying everyone.

Ueki is even the first to get a hit off of Hanon as he transfers the energy from his Raika to his Seikku in order to match Hanon's speed. At this point, Hanon unleashes his Maoh, the level 10 Sacred Treasure, and we finally get to see it. Maoh is a summoned creature that takes on a random form and is as powerful as the will of it's user. Ueki also summons Maoh, which takes on the form of Kobayashi, but is still less powerful than Hanon. Hanon seems to be getting the better of Ueki, until he reveals a secret: Maoh can only be summoned six times, and Hanon is on his last one because Robert used it twice before the fight. However, Ueki still has two. Just as Ueki feels defeated, Ai calls to him and Ueki finds his will: the will to protect his friends. His Maoh finally overpowers Hanon's, and Hanon runs out of Maoh. As a reward, he spits out Robert. Without Robert, however, he can no longer use Roberts power. He explains why he spits him out. With Robert, Hanon was limited by how many Zai Robert had. Now that he has been spit out, he is no longer limited in the number of Zai. This is unlike Ueki, who is not technically fighting a competitor of the tournament. And because he only has 18 Zai left, Ueki only has 18 chances to take out Hanon.",
