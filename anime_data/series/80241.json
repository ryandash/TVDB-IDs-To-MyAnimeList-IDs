    "TitleEnglish": "Toward the Terra",
    "SummaryEnglish": "In the dystopic future of Toward the Terra, a battered humanity has abandoned its ecologically devastated homeworld and relinquished control to computers. All new humans are spawned in test tubes, delivered to randomly selected couples, and then raised to age 14. On their \"Waking Day,\" they`re taken to space stations where their memories are erased and they become blank slates suitable for training as good, obedient citizens.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes a Waking child develops psychic powers. These psychics, called Mu, can fight off mental conditioning and are considered a threat to the reverentially praised \"SD System,\" which rules human life. If they can escape summary execution--not likely, since Mu usually have weak or damaged bodies to balance out their overdeveloped brains--they may come to live in a community apart from regular humans. The Mu, unlike normals, are aware they aren`t living on Earth, and they long to return \"home.\"\r\n\r\nJomy Shin, a 14-year-old who has no idea he`s about to be hunted by humans and embraced by the Mu, is an exception to the rule. He has a strong young body as well as a strong young mind, and despite his horror and loathing of the Mu, he becomes their chosen leader. They`ll certainly need someone of his mental and physical power to combat humanity`s new leader, an exceptional boy who is controlled by humankind`s computers, but still remains independent enough to ask the significant question, \"If the computers` system is perfect and in complete control, why is it still permitting Mu to be born?\"",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Swena broadcasts Keith's message to humanity about the truth behind Grandmother's ideals. The final truth about the Mu genes is revealed: before the creation of SD system, scientists discovered the mutant Mu genes and arguments ensued as to whethere they were only a flick of mutation or the next phase of evolution. Unable to decide, the SD system was programmed to leave Mu genes intact in birth control process, only to carry out the extermination when the gene carrier reached adulthood; the purpose was to check whether they could survive the stress and became the next phase of evolution. As such, the Mu survived, confirming their superiority; the only problem being that the Grandmother system has flawed programming and cannot accept the Mu. Keith broadcast this revelation for all humans to see, urging them to finally take over the decision and not relying on SD system any longer, while choosing to maintain the system for the sake of controlling human as a bet on human's future. Acknowledging Keith's decision, Grandmother's programming moved to phase 4: eliminate Mu factor in birth progress, and order Keith to kill Jomy. Keith & Jomy decide to fight Grandmother and are fatally wounded. Tony is chosen by Jomy to destroy the Meggidos pointed at Terra and to stand up as the next Soldier. Keith calls his subordinates to also destroy the Meggido units along with the Mu. The Meggido units are destroyed with the help of General Murdock who rams into it with his ship and Terra is saved from obliteration. Humans everywhere are shown rebelling against the SD system and Tony stands up as the next leader of the Mu to bring humans and Mu together. The final scene after the credits shows a reborn Earth as both the humans and Mu had hoped it would become.",
