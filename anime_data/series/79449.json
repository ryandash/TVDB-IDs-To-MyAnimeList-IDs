Inspired by fairy tales and the works of Herman Hesse and Kenji Miyazawa, Revolutionary Girl Utena is a surreal, symbolistic and psychological coming-of-age drama with bold artistic flair.",

Tsuwabuki asks Utena what he has to do to become a grown-up. Utena says it is probably to experience various things. Tsuwabuki tries to \"experience various things\" by watching kiss-scenes in films. Mari makes a fun of him, saying it is obvious that one who has experienced a real kiss is more grown up than one who has seen a hundred kiss-scenes. Tsuwabuki tries to do it with Mari and gets slapped. Nanami witnesses. When she asks him about the affair, Tsuwabuki realizes that he is treated as a child after all. At Nemuro Memorial Hall, he confesses that he wishes to grow up right now. Mikage takes advantage of him.",

The reason why she named him \"Onion Prince\" is that when they were very young and she was made fun of her hair as \"Onion Headed\", he helped her out as \"Onion Prince\" (but the flashback doesn't look like...). Gradually, Utena figures out that Wakaba is still in love with him. Utena tells Wakaba to be more honest. Besides, Utena also finds that Tatsuya is actually still in love with Wakaba and the reason why he sent Utena a love-letter is to get close to Wakaba. Then Utena tells Tatsuya that it's worth confessing his feelings to Wakaba because Utena is sure that they are both in love with each other. Now what's left is that Tatsuya confesses to her on the hill with the legendary tree. So far such a beautiful story! However...\r\nWakaba's \"prince\" appears to be someone else... Oh, well. C'est la vie. Tatsuya consults at Nemuro Memorial Hall. But Mikage says \"You're really a good person, aren't you? So, there's no path for you to take here. Please leave.\"\r\nGuess who is Wakaba's \"prince\" --- It's Saionji!",

But instead of fighting, Mikage decides to include Utena in his side, and asks Utena to join his Mikage Seminar, but Utena turns it down. Mikage talks about Nemuro Memorial Hall, where Mikage now holds his seminar. Decades ago, there was a professor called Professor Nemuro, who was doing some research at the hall. One day, there was a fire, and the hall burned down, which took away 100 lives of his students.\r\nProfessor Nemuro was actually Mikage himself. He used to work with 100 brilliant schoolboys on Project Rose Signet, which was a research to revolutionize the world and obtain eternity. Since it was only a contract with the academy, or Akio himself, Professor Nemuro was indifferent about the objectives. One day, an inspector from the trustee, Chida Tokiko, came to Professor Nemuro's office. Later, Tokiko invited Professor Nemuro to her home. And Mikage met Tokiko's brother Chida Mamiya for the first time. Mamiya had a fatal disease, and for his sake, Tokiko wanted to get eternity that the academy was seeking for. From this day, Professor Nemuro became enthusiastic about the research. Afterwards, Akio appeared in Professor Nemuro's office, and gave him a ring with the Rose Signet and made a contract of the Rose Signet with him: \"I suppose you have no choice but to revolutionize the world. The way before has been prepared,\" Akio said. One night, Mamiya set fire to the hall. Professor Nemuro said to Tokiko that Mamiya was right, and this sacrifice of 100 lives was the necessary first step to reach the stage of the revolution from the academy.\r\nBack to the present time, Tokiko, now an old woman, comes to the academy to visit Mamiya's *grave*, and also meet Akio for the first time after the decades. She says Professor Nemuro, as well as Akio, is still as young as he was back then.",

Utena notices that Mikage is behind this whole thing. Utena challenges Mikage to a duel.\r\nDuring the duel, Mikage tells Utena that Utena is the same as him in the sense that Utena met somebody who completely changed the life, and can't get over it. That's why she is a Duelist first of all. Later in the middle of the duel, Mikage suddenly hears Mamiya's voice, which says Mikage will be beaten. Mikage finds in Mamiya's position of the photographs someone he doesn't know --- He finally recalls this boy was the real Mamiya for the first time after decades. The real Mamiya actually died back then, and it was Mikage who set fire to the hall. And this whole thing about Mikage was all Akio's plot; For a long time, Akio has been manipulating Mikage's mind to take advantage of his brain (Mikage was the one who opened the way to the castle), besides Akio says that Mikage didn't even exist in the first place, just like Mamiya didn't.",
