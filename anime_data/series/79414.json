Once again, none of the Brigade members can devise anything to stop the cycle from repeating. On their final meeting in the restaurant, Kyon tries to call out after Haruhi but fails to do anything as visions of the loop's events flash in his mind. As Kyon regains his senses, Haruhi has left. As the last day of vacation arrives, Kyon, resigned to the loop repeating itself, goes to bed without finishing his summer homework.",

She yells at her, demanding that Asahina try to shoot a laser beam from her contact-lens-colored eye, but Kyon manages to cool her down . Afterwards the scene is reshot but, to the surprise of everyone except Haruhi, Mikuru actually shoots laser beams from her eye. Yuki knocks Mikuru down and apparently takes her contact lens. In a conversation Itsuki explains to a shocked Kyon that Haruhi changed reality once again and Nagato proves his words by showing her hand, burnt while protecting Kyon from being hit by the laser. Koizumi promises to take care of Mikuru's problem with Yuki's help. The rest of day is spent on shooting more scenes with Mikuru dressed as a bunny girl. The next day Kyon finds out that Haruhi dragged Tsuruya, Taniguchi and Kunikida to help. After Haruhi gets off to pick up Mikuru, Itsuki explains to Kyon that Yuki succesfully helped Mikuru get over herself. Haruhi returns with Mikuru, who secretely tells Kyon how Yuki helped her: she bit her to inject nanomachines into her body. Haruhi leads everyone to the next shooting location, a lake near Koizumi's house.",

Yuki quickly takes action and injects her with more nanomachines before any damage could be done. Despite the weird phenomena Haruhi's film is causing, Itsuki suggests it is better than more closed spaces being opened up. However, when Kyon discovers Haruhi arranged for Mikuru to be drugged for a kiss scene with Itsuki, he gets furious at her shabby treatment of Mikuru and almost hits her, forcing Itsuki to hold him back. This causes Haruhi to become depressed, having always thought Kyon would support her. Kyon, reluctantly learning something from Taniguchi, later apologizes to Haruhi and filming resumes. However, he seems to have inadvertently encouraged Haruhi even more, making cherry blossoms grow out of season.",

The next day at school, Mikuru gives him a coupon for her class's yakisoba café, and gives her views on Haruhi that she couldn't say in front of Itsuki. Kyon later talks with Yuki, who throws up the idea that one of them, including herself, may be lying. As shooting resumes, Haruhi's powers to continue to make Mikuru a deadly weapon. Itsuki calls Kyon out later that night, asking him to find a way to hold back Haruhi's powers. Kyon convinces Haruhi to add a disclaimer at the end, saying the film is a work of fiction, and the rest of the shooting goes without a hitch. Kyon falls asleep whilst editing the movie, only to find it has edited itself overnight. At the very last of this episode, there is a flashback to May that Kyon tries telling Haruhi that Yuki, Mikuru and Itsuki are actually aliens, time travelers and espers, but she doesn't believe him.",
