The characters are pictured quite differently from the way they are in the original Manga, and several arguments occurred over the production of this animated cartoon itself. However, the high quality direction by Rintaro added stability to the work. The story is about two characters, Akanemaru, a sculpture genius, and ex-burglar Gao whose only purpose in life is sculpting, and how they struggle with the fate to compete with each other over their capacity and talent.",
