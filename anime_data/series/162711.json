However, Mato starts to hesitate when she realises how she had been running away from her own feelings. Just then, Strength starts to speak and goes beserk on Black Rock Shooter, revealing she is actually the real Yuu. Strength, the Yuu that Mato knew, explains how she gained emotions when Yuu, who was filled with an extraordinary amount of sorrow, was able to contact her, stopping her from dying at the hands of Black Rock Shooter. Finding a world of fighting better than the world she lived in, Yuu decided to switch places with Strength so that she would have to face reality instead. Meanwhile, as word reaches school that Mato had not returned home, Yomi feels a pain in her heart and remembers her friendship with her, which in turn causes Dead Master to reawaken.",
