Moya wins the challenge and they continue the debate their situation. As payment for losing, Moya asks Baifeng to accompany him to see the new resident of the Sparrow Pavilion. They observe a beautiful woman playing music on an invisible Guqin (sounds like a piano). Baifeng agrees that she is beautiful, but she is the property of General Ji Wuye. Baifeng spends the next few days listening to her play at a distance. Moya reveals that her name is Nong Yu. Secretly, Baifeng leaves her a Zither which she plays beautifully and many birds flock to listen, as well as Baifeng. She tells Baifeng that the music is called Birdsong in Hollow Valley. Moya reminds Baifeng that the Sparrow Pavilion and all that’s in it belong to General Ji Wuye. The next day, the general questions the staff about the appearance of the zither and the disappearance of his pet yellow oriole, caged next to the falcon. He suspects his falcon of killing the oriole and strangles it in full view of his frightened staff, and then has the staff hanged. He then gives Moya a mission.",

On his way to deliver food to the meeting Pao Ding is intercepted by Li Si who says that he'd heard about a banquet being prepared and invites himself to attend at Pao Ding's Youjian Inn. General Meng and Star Wraith arrive at the Confucian's Junior Sage Village with orders to search for rebels. The Mohists and Taoists discuss the information from the Black Dragon Scroll that shows Emperor Ying Zheng was coming to Shanghai on completion of the Mirage. Because the Mirage was built by the Gongshu Clan and Yin and Yang School, they assume that Emperor Ying Zheng will arrive when it is ready to depart, and when the Azure Dragon will be activated. They believe the Mount Shu group are also interested in the Mirage. Ge Nie explains the structure of the Yin and Yang School headed by Deity of Clouds (Xu Fu). He told Emperor Ying Zheng that there are three Immortal Mountains – Penglai, Fangzhang and Yingzhou - outside the East Sea of Shanghai city inhabited by immortals. The aim of the Mirage is to travel there and get the elixir of immortality. Li Si arrives at Pao Ding's Inn and greets the cloaked guests, who reveal themselves to be the Confucian School leaders including Master Xun. Master Xun is rude to Li Si who chooses to ignore the insults and leaves.",

It then breaks after Meng Tian shoots a final arrow at it. Tou Man falls as the wall collapses and his Xiongnu soldiers flee in fear. Meng Tian cuts off the chief's right ear, to partly collect on the wager, but a warrior woman attacks Meng Tian with twin chakrams. She unseats a Qin warrior and rides off with Tou Man. Meng Tian and the Qin soldiers charge in pursuit. Back on the Mirage, Shaoyu awakens to find he and Shi Lan are chained. Yunzhong Jun recognizes Shi Lan as a Yu Yuan Guardian of Mount Shu and plans to make her subservient like her older brother Yu Zi Qi.

Meanwhile, Tianming has fallen to the bottom of the hole (Season 5, Episode 18). He sees the three legged crow and follows it into a cavern devoid of warmth. He sees a woman is standing within a blue central podium and he asks who she is.",

At the Mohist group, Zifang says it is clear the internal struggle in the Empire is to undermine Fu Su.

Lord Changping suppressed the rebellion against the Han in Xinzhang started by Quicksand, but when Ying Zheng decided to attack the Chu a year later, he tricked Ying Zheng into sending an under equipped General Li Xin. Lord Changping turned against Li Xin who was utterly defeated, then he counter-attacked the Qin territories as the new commander of the Chu. Zifang finally understood the Xinzhang rebellion failure was due to an arrangement between Quicksand and Lord Changping.

Suppressing the pain from the curse, Tianming manages to pull Momei free of the ice. At this, Yan Fei, who is also the former Princess Consort of Yan Dan, begins to understand why Dan chose Tianming. The Mohists discuss how Lord Changping's father was a prince of Chu held hostage in Qin and his mother was a Qin princess. Lord Changping earned Ying Zheng's utmost trust and was made prime minister. During the war between Qin and Chu, Xiang Liang and his father had a secret meeting with Lord Changping, where all the schemes and plans started. When the Chu fought 600,000 Qin soldiers they lost because they were outnumbered. Xiang Liang's father killed himself, refusing to surrender and Lord Changping committed suicide on the city wall, shedding his blood on his homeland. The Mohists helped Shaoyu to escape. Because Fu Su's mother and Ying Zheng's queen was Chu, the Net Trap Organization used Ying Zheng's hatred of Chu and Lord Changping to turn him against Fu Su. However the attempted assassination was obvious to Ying Zheng who is not blind. Fu Su tells Meng Tian his Chu descent is a shackle, but Meng Tian tells Fu Su to look at things from the Emperor's viewpoint. Sending Fu Su North to Meng Tian was to protect him. Fu Su realizes the truth of this and swears not to disappoint his father again. He then collapses from being poisoned.

Later, Yan Dan becomes the new Mohist Leader after Black Hero mysteriously dies from the Fearsome Curse of the Six Souls. He confronts his wife, knowing She is responsible. She explains she did it for Yan Dan and their daughter Yuer; but he suspected it was because of her background as Lord Dongjun of the Yin Yang School and rejected her, leaving her heartbroken. Back in the present, Yan Fei notes that Tianming is at least at the 7th level of Universal Love. She is amazed at two things: One, he carries both the Moon Goddess's curse, Mark of Closed Eyes (one of the eight curses of Yang) and this curse neutralizes the contradictory Fearsome Curse of the Six Souls (one of the eight curses of Yin). Second, his body contains not only Dan's strength but she guesses also that of Ge Nie, his second Master. Tianming swears to defeat her, but when he also declares his intention to save Yuer, she heals him and makes the curse dormant for the time being.
