However, Gorgo could not do this alone, as he had to take over the mind of man's best friend and turn them into humanity's worst nightmare. As the pack of dogs ran through the streets of Tokyo, the massive reptile joined the brutal assault! Bursting out of the ground, Gorgo stomped through the streets of Tokyo, roaring his fury and using his massive head as a battering ram to destroy buildings around him. Soon, his dogs found a school and Gorgo followed, stomping on the building with his massive feet. The D-Force soon arrived and started to fire missiles at the saurian to no avail. After trying to bring down the ship with his flame breath, the Tachibana twins combined, turning their ship into Super Aizenborg. The warship flew directly through the dinosaur, causing the super saurian to explode from the inside out and ending the life of Ururu’s first minion",

Shrugging off the assault, Chirako charged at the ground vehicle Aizen 1, which moved quickly out of the way, causing the enraged dinosaur to run head first into a building. When Ai and Zen went to combine into Super Aizenborg, they found a massive crater where the saurian once stood. It wasn't long before Chirako reappeared, bursting out of the ground near Tokyo Tower! With a well aimed blast, the dinosaur fired his heat beam at the tower's foundation, causing it to tip! The Super Aizenborg flew in, using itself to prop the building up for the civilians to escape, as Chirako once again disappeared underground.",
