However, Kurei, who was able to make his way out of his prison during the destruction of the village, found them and tried to get to Recca, and was sent into the future as well.\r\nMikagami was able to sense the presence of the three interlopers while Kagero was telling her her story and they all proceeded to engage them in combat.

After the battle, Recca finally acknowledged Kagero as his mother and tried to check if she was alright, but found out that he is unable to touch her, as the forbidden spell that Kagero used ensured that mother and son cannot make contact.",

Near the end of the bout, Domon used his Kuchibashi-oh which chains bound and defeated Minamio and emerged Domon victoriously. However, Tokiya said that Domon used the Madogu too late which made the latter fall unconscious as well despite saying \"I won!\" which resulted in a draw. (NOTE:There is a comic relief in this episode. When Kukai requested for paper from Saicho, the referee thought that the Kuu leader was about to make an announcement. However, Kukai used the paper as a tissue to blow his nose. He even asked the referee if she wanted to keep it as a souvenir). The bout between Fujimaru and Fuuko begins. The episode ends with Fujimaru countering Fuuko's darts and starts throwing sickles at Fuuko stripping off her long sleeves.",

However, Kouran Mori appears in the screen and decided to make some changes. He proposed that all of the previous fights will be discarded, and the winner of the match will advance in the next round. Recca provokingly accepts the proposal. During the fight, Kukai warned Recca that he only has to hit the Kuu master 3 times in any method, after which, it could mean certain death for Recca. Nobody was able to comprehend what Kukai really meant except Daikoku who had a flashback of what happens afterwards. But Recca was reluctant and attacked Kukai with Nadare. Kukai deflects the fireballs with his hands. However, he missed one. Recca has two hits left, so he decided to use Saiha against Kukai but avoids it. Recca kicks Kukai in the face but later gets up and laughs. Now the young ninja only has one strike left. This time, Kukai will not move. If Recca knocks Kukai out, he wins. But if Kukai still has the strength to fight, Recca dies. Daikoku warns Recca not to do it, but Hanabishi was still persistent and gave Kukai a mighty punch. Kukai gets up and activates his madogu, Oni, a demonic necklace that activates after the user is hit three times, turning the possessor in to a perfect killing machine. Both Kagero and Genjuro explained this fact. Kukai began beating Recca up badly. Minamio, who was shocked told his teammates that everybody has a lust for killing just like everybody else, even a gentle and serene teacher like Kukai.
