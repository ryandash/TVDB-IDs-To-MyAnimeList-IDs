While Recca refuses to believe, she tells all of them the truth of 400 years ago: Oka, the Hokage clan's leader and a flame master, had two sons: Recca with his wife Kagero, and Kurei with his mistress Reina, making Kurei and Recca half-brothers. Kurei, who exhibited flame powers as a child, was slated to inherit the clan leadership, but it was soon discovered that Recca also possessed the same powers. According to prophecy, only one member of the Hokage clan can use the powers of flame in each generation, and when there are two of them at the same time, one of them is bearing a cursed flame which can lead to the end of the clan's existence. The clan elders determined that Kurei was the one with the cursed flame, and sentenced him to death, but was spared upon Kagero's request. Meanwhile, while Kagero was telling them all of this, three members of the Uruha under Kurei's orders was spying on them, having discovered the hidden passageway towards the hideout, and was planning to attack them all unaware.",

Meanwhile, the warlord Oda Nobunaga was preparing to attack the Hokage, with the hopes of stealing the Madogu and use their powers to conquer Japan. The Hokage clan, out of fear that the Madogu will fall into the wrong hands, decided to fight Nobunaga's soldiers without using them, but were overwhelmed by sheer numbers and were all defeated. Kagero, in a last desperate attempt to save her son, used a forbidden spell to open a time portal and send Recca into the future, at the cost of being immortal. However, Kurei, who was able to make his way out of his prison during the destruction of the village, found them and tried to get to Recca, and was sent into the future as well.\r\nMikagami was able to sense the presence of the three interlopers while Kagero was telling her her story and they all proceeded to engage them in combat. It turns out however, that they are not able to use their Madogu well, and they were all able to defeat them quickly. One of them, however took Kagero hostage and was about to kill her (pointlessly, as she is immortal), but Recca was angered by this and unconsciously summoned Nadare, his first flame dragon, to defeat him. After the battle, Recca finally acknowledged Kagero as his mother and tried to check if she was alright, but found out that he is unable to touch her, as the forbidden spell that Kagero used ensured that mother and son cannot make contact.",
