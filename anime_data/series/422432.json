Afterward she became a NEET and a gamer who lived in her grandmother's house. But one day she is suddenly thrown into the world of racing.\r\n\r\nThe anime takes place in the near future, where the latest technology has made it so vehicles can travel at 500 km/h (about 310 mph) safely and securely. A next-generation race event called NEX Race is born, which changes the world of racing. NEX Racing features AI control support and a \"Revolburst\" mechanism. A newcomer named Rin Rindoh will make her debut in NEX Race, and will further revolutionize the sport.",
