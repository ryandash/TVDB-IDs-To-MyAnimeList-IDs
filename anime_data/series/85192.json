However even within the darkness, Kenshiro's pengyou, Charles de Guise, Liu Fei Yan and Yasaka light the way for him and he finds his way back to Kenshin. Kenshiro utilizes the ultimate technique of Blue Dragon Heavenly Silk as he and Kenshin battle each other with their fists until Kenshiro lands a punishing blow on Kenshin's chest. They admit their grudging respect for each other and dedication to achieving their ideals, but Kenshin tricks Kenshiro into delivering a killing blow finally ending his dream for a re-genesis. Later, Fei Yan returns to the orphanage with Fei He and Erika, and Ramon continues his training. Elsewhere, Kenshiro lays down on a rocky outcrop above the clouds, gazing at the blue sky as he smokes his last cigarette.",
