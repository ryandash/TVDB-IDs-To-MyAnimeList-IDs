After quickly deducing Kon's identity, Inari accompanies Shiro to the supermarket where his mother works, with Shiro becoming upset when he sees her mother being busy and running off yet again. Wanting to defuse the situation, Inari transforms into Shiro's mother and offers to play with fireworks with him and Kōji, only to find the reason he was crying because he realised he was bothering his mother at work. In the end, Shiro plays fireworks with Kōji and Inari, before their mother manages to sort out a shift change to spend some time with them, whilst Kon learns something from her experience.",
