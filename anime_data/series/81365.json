After knocking out several agents pursuing Kōki, Rin takes him to her office where he tells her and her partner Mimi that although he is not amnesiac, he feels that his memory is fake and he would like to know why he is pursued. Through Rin's links, they find out that Kōki is connected to the Aoyama Pharmaceutical company. With Mimi's help, they infiltrate its labs but are captured. Rin is tortured to death by the sadistic chief researcher Sayara Yamanobe, while Kōki is revealed to be a runaway cloning test subject. Miraculously, Rin survives, completely healed of her injuries, and confronts Yamanobe, leaving her in the hands of other delirious test subjects.

He is revealed to possess one himself but it is stolen soon afterwards and he is severely injured. As Rin looks through his belongings, she is attacked by Laura who quickly detonates a suicide bomb. Meanwhile, Maeno meets a girl named Yuki who is looking for an \"angel\" that may know the whereabouts of her missing brother Shōgo. Attracted by the explosion, he finds Rin's mutilated body and is visibly shaken by witnessing her regenerate. Later, Mimi explains to him that both Rin and herself are immortal because of the \"time spores\" inside their bodies. In the meantime, several people including Rin's client are murdered and before long, she confirms that Yuki's brother turned into an \"angel\" due to contact with time spores leading him to commit the recent murders as acts of revenge. She also reveals that angels are natural enemies of the immortals like herself: in their presence, immortals are overcome with lust and angels use that time to devour them. Rin then deduces who Shōgo's final victim would be and confronts him only to seemingly give in to sexual desire. As the angel starts feasting on her, she manages to kill him. An apparition of Eipos, a demigod appearing briefly throughout the series, emerges nearby to claim Shōgo's time spore but Rin gives it to Maeno instead and he, in turn, to Yuki. In the final scene, Rin returns the stolen stamp to \"Sensei\" who laments how his life was wasted on it.",
