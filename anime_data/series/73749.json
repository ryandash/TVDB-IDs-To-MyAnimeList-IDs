Following the events of the first Ghost in the Shell movie, Major Motoko Kusanagi has since left her physical body and is now a \"ghost\" living in the network. This leaves Batou as the top officer at Section 9, the special task force assigned to matters of human/machine relations. Batou's latest assignment is to investigate the recent string of suicide-murders perpetrated by a certain brand of \"gynoids,\" androids designed to look like women. Together with officer Togusa (one of the last few people who hasn't had his body fitted with cybernetic parts), Batou tracks down the cause of the wayward gynoids — all the while pondering and discussing the hazy realms where machines become dangerously close to human, and humans become dangerously close to machines.",

Blindfold Ivan uses the same modus operandi in its abductions: over a three-day period, multiple underage women are kidnapped and then shipped to chop shops where they are killed, and all organs and cybernetic pieces are taken to be sold on the black market. Kanzaki had previously downplayed these mass kidnappings and denied the existence of Blindfold Ivan in an effort to strengthen ties between Russia and Japan; however, he publicly reveals the kidnapping of his daughter at Aramaki’s request in order to save his daughter. The news abruptly changes the situation by thrusting the kidnapping ring's leader, an ex-SVR officer named Cruzkowa Bosyeltnov, into the center of a scandalous, nationwide media event.",
