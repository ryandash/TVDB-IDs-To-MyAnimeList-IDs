Meanwhile, Jubei apologies to Imai over the contest but doesn't understand why Nobuna is angry at her. Imai explains that Nobuna treats her retainers like her family because she has a poor relationship with her mother and seeing Jubei's horrible attitude on the others reminded her of that. Later, the Oda faction learns the Takeda and Uesugi clans have made peace and probably planning to attack Owari and Mino from the east. Not expecting this, Yoshiharu asks Nobuna not to send all of their forces to deal with the Takeda/Uesugi alliance when Yoshimoto is about to become Shogun but she refuses to listen as she's worried about her mother and Dōsan's safety. Nagahide and Katsuie lead the Oda army back to the east, unaware it's a ruse by the Miyoshi Three to allow them to kill Yoshimoto and Nobuna.",
