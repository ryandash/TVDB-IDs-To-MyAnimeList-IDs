    "SummaryEnglish": "Maburaho is a romantic comedy of magical proportions, about a high school magician who suddenly becomes the target of three beautiful girls. The main character is a somewhat depressed seventeen-year-old high school student, Kazuki Shikimori. He attends, rather reluctantly, the elite Aoi Academy, a school for training people in the intricacies of powerful magic. In this world, where the ability to use magic is paramount, each magician is limited in the number of times he or she can use magic spells, and performing more spells than the limit allows will cause the user to die and turn into dust. In this regard, unlike the average enrolled magician whose limit is typically in the thousands, Kazuki is considered an underachiever, since he can only wield magic a mere eight times during his entire life.",
