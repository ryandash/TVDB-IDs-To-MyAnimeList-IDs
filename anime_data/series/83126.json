He was defeated by the Tora-ge Akita Gin in Ohu's Futago Pass using the Battouga. The peace that has reigned in Ohu since then is shattered when a monster begins to ravage the stronghold. This forces Gin's mate Sakura, pregnant with Gin's pups, and a veteran from the final battle with Akakabuto, Smith, to flee Futago Pass. Six months after, Sakura is deathly ill, and her son is taking care of her. While out hunting for his mother, the six month old meets GB, a cowardly English Setter. He later tries to save GB and GB's friend Sasuke from a guard dog, but has to be rescued by Smith. Leading Smith to his mother, the puppy finds Sakura on her death-bed. As she dies, Sakura tells Smith to bring her son to Ohu to meet his father. Named Weed by GB, the young son of Gin begins the long journey to the Ohu mountains.",
