After settling into his new apartment, he discovers a small peephole in the wall of his room that gives him a view into his neighbor’s apartment. To his shock, his neighbor — Emiru Ikuno — is already aware of the hole and uses it to spy on him as well.\r\nInstead of sealing it up, Emiru proposes a strange \"peeping relationship\": both of them will take turns watching each other through the hole under specific rules. What begins as a voyeuristic and awkward arrangement evolves into a complicated, emotionally charged relationship filled with trust issues, hidden trauma, manipulation, and sexual tension.\r\nThe OVA adapts the early part of the manga — focusing on their initial meeting, the peephole discovery, and the beginnings of their twisted yet intimate relationship.",
