    "TitleEnglish": "Umineko: When They Cry",
    "SummaryEnglish": "The affluent Ushiromiya family patriarch, Kinzo, is on his deathbed, and his family has assembled at their private island to discuss the division of his estate. As they bicker over their father's immense inheritance, a typhoon closes in, trapping them on the island. They suddenly receive an eerie word of warning...and then, in the dead of night, the murders begin. \r\n\r\nOne by one, family members are discovered murdered in bizarre and inhuman ways. Some within the family turn to superstition, blaming it on a witch rumored to inhabit the island. But one of them - the young Battler Ushiromiya - refuses to accept the supernatural and vows to uncover the real killer behind the seemingly impossible slaughters. He soon finds himself confronted by the apparent witch, and enters into a life-or-death battle for the truth.",

Battler, who has not attended the conference in six years, notices a new painting in the foyer of the mansion. He is told that it is a portrait of the \"Golden Witch\" Beatrice, who had supposedly given Kinzo all his wealth, and who Kinzo desires to see again. Battler, however, does not believe in witches or magic, and doubts she exists. A typhoon approaches the island, and Maria is left outside by her mother Rosa while searching for a wilted rose George had marked for her in the garden. When it begins to rain, Battler, Jessica, George, and Rosa go outside to find Maria with an umbrella she did not have before, which Maria says Beatrice gave her.",

The contents stipulate that Beatrice will take everything the Ushiromiya family owns if no one can solve the witch's cryptic epitaph. While Kinzo's sons and daughters try to ask him what this is about, they are not able to enter his study. The rest of the night has the adults staying up still discussing the family inheritance while the children retreat to the guesthouse. That night, George gives Shannon an engagement ring, and asks her to give her reply the next day. The following morning, six people have gone missing, and Natsuhi is informed of a strange symbol drawn on the outdoor tool shed. When she goes to investigate with Kanon and Genji, they find the missing six people brutally murdered inside.

Ange recounts how she too was once a member of this alliance and learned how to summon the seven Sisters of Purgatory, becoming close friends with Mammon in the process. By the year 1998, however, she loses the ability to use magic, and continues her investigation of the Rokkenjima murders. Before she returns to the game, Ange is confronted by Lambdadelta, who tells her that if Battler defeats Beatrice, he will return to her past self in 1986 while her current self will remain alone, and proposes that Ange can remain with her brother if he continues to fight against Beatrice for eternity.",

Ange lashes out against her magical friends for being helpless against the magical resistance of her classmates and denounces them as illusions, prompting Maria to expel her from Mariage Sorcière. Inside the world of her diary, Maria accidentally locks herself out of her house with Sakutaro while Rosa is away on vacation with her boyfriend instead of being at work as she told Maria. Upon returning and being confronted by child services, Rosa takes her anger out on Maria and destroys Sakutaro, who Beatrice is unable to resurrect as Rosa created his vessel and has denied his existence. Distraught, Maria demands to learn magic to kill her mother and avenge Sakutaro. In 1998, Ange finally comprehends what Maria tried to teach her about magic and apologizes to the Sisters of Purgatory and Sakutaro, who she is still able to summon, hoping to atone for what she did to Maria.",

Meanwhile, the hostages are able to break out of Kuwadorian, but are killed off one by one on their way to the mansion until only Kyrie remains. Before she too is killed, Kyrie calls Battler as well and tells him to believe in witches. Afterward, Maria is sent off to take her test when Battler receives another phone call, this time from the newly revived Beatrice, and goes to meet her at the mansion entrance, discovering Gohda and Kumasawa dead in the storehouse on his way there. Beatrice gives Battler his test: to remember a sin he committed six years ago. However, Battler is clueless as to what that may be, much to Beatrice's frustration, prompting her to take her anger out on Kinzo by spontaneously killing him. Having lost her interest in the game, Beatrice decides to suspend it by deeming Battler unqualified to be her opponent, revealing that his birth mother was not Rudolf's first wife Asumu as he had believed, and claiming that he is not Kinzo's grandson Battler, the only one eligible to fight her. Questioning his own identity, Battler fades away, and Beatrice retires to the newly opened Golden Land with Maria.",

Desperate to revive Battler, Ange confirms his qualifications as Kinzo's grandson, and reveals her own identity as his sister to him, successfully restoring him. Having broken the most important rule as a piece in the game to keep her identity a secret, however, Ange dies. With Battler's resolve strengthened and Beatrice realizing she cannot escape the game, the two engage each other in their final confrontation, with Battler's blue truth against Beatrice's red truth. Kinzo's spirit appears to protect Beatrice, but Battler dispels him in blue by confirming his death not only at the start of the fourth game, but every game thus far; however, Beatrice confirms in red that there are actually no more than seventeen people on Rokkenjima. Nevertheless, Battler manages to explain all four games through human means, while Beatrice is left completely skewered by his blue truth, but unable to die. Beatrice begs Battler to kill her and presents him the last mystery she is able to give: since Battler is the only person left alive on the island, and yet Beatrice is also there to kill him, Beatrice asks, \"Who am I?\" Understanding Beatrice's plight, Battler promises to solve her final mystery and put an end to her suffering. Bernkanstel and Lambdadelta, however, intend to keep Beatrice in the game, torturing her for eternity.",
