After narrowly missing their flight, Akira and Hikaru are escorted to the Raft by Pepper Potts, courtesy of Tony Stark. During this time, a special presentation on the Raft is being held with several superheroes and VIPs in attendance, including three children, Edward Grant, Chris Taylor, and Jessica Shannon. Upon reuniting with his father, Akira is not particular happy that Tony is taking credit for Nozomu's project, the DISK system, which is designed for capturing supervillains, though Nozomu's assistant, Peter Parker, assures Akira it is because they wanted to protect them. Unbeknownst to anyone, mysterious characters sneak into the cells of the supervillains and help them escape by storing them inside the aforementioned DISKs. Whilst Edward, Chris, and Jessica sneak off to try and get closer to their favorite superheroes, Loki suddenly appears above the Raft and uses the DISKs to unleash supervillains all over the island. When Akira, Hikaru, and Nozomu are attacked by the Crimson Dynamo, who is looking for an 'installer', they are assisted by the arrival of Spider-Man.",

Chris, remembering an argument with his parents about his uncertain future, decides to rejoin the team after seeing the Hulk on the news. Hulk, under secretive alchemic mind control by Diablo at the command of Menino, goes on a destructive rampage, forcing the team (including Chris) to go into action. While Jessica and Ed use their wits to find a way out of their cell, Iron Man and Thor are easily defeated by Hulk, who sees them as monsters of their own. With all the adrenaline overriding his uncertainty, Chris finally releases Captain America, who prepares to stand and face the still-rampaging Hulk.",

After forcing Hulk to tire himself out, Captain America goes from playing defense to outwitting Hulk to forcing him into a test of endurance, which Hulk loses.

Jessica takes out Wasp's DISK and a wristband, having snuck through the air vents to the room where they were kept, and releases Wasp. Despite Tim's intervention with an extremely arrogant M.O.D.O.K., Wasp frees Spider-Man and helps Jessica and Ed escape while Spider-Man decides to stay and keep M.O.D.O.K., Diablo, Abomination, and Whirlwind. As King Cobra closes in on their position in the air shafts, Jessica and Wasp send Ed to put out an S.O.S., which is picked up by the team.

In the present, Iron Man explains how every hero in villain is split into one of the five classes, and that every Biocode is permanently locked onto the first one D-Smashed. This explains how Akira, locked to Tech-class DISKS, failed to D-Smash Hulk and then as an example Thor. On the frigate, Loki's five masked colleagues wait impatiently for him. While King Cobra captures Jessica and Riley takes the DISK containing Wasp, Iron Man asks to be released and sent to face the tornado with Hulk's DISK and a wristband in hand. After barely making it through alive with as much moral support as possible from Akira (despite the dissuasions from the rest of his team) Ed catches Hulk's DISK and attracts attention while heading the wristband. Biting King Cobra to get free, Jessica tosses Ed the wristband. Hulk, upon being released by Ed, faces against what's left against Diablo's alchemic control, knocking the villain into Whirlwind and knocking out the tornado. Captain America and Thor join Iron Man and Hulk on the ground, and thanks to some learned trickery Jessica brings Wasp back into the mix after getting her DISK back from Riley. With the heroes, villains, and their DISK-controlling partners all lined up for battle, Captain America finishes the episode with the iconic battle cry: \"Avengers Assemble!\"",

Eventually, Iron Man decides to compensate for this by building Akira a pair of jet-powered roller skates called Booster Skates. While testing them out outdoors, Akira and Iron Man find out the hard way that the Booster Skates have a bug in them that won't allow them to brake. Interrupting a brother-based conversation between Hikaru and Thor, Akira and his Booster Skates go out of control, and even Thor can't catch him due to an auto-evade feature Stark put in. Plus, Akira's biocode has yet to recharge. Pepper tries to call everyone else for help, but no one else answers. Eventually, Thor breaks the ground right in front of a dead end, launching him into the air for the catching, but his time limit expires. Hikaru catches Akira's arm, nearly dragging the both of them down. Akira's biocode finishes recharging at the nick of time, and Iron Man catches them.

After winning the battle for the Avengers, Rhodey officially introduces himself at the condo, and due to the DISKs' limitations has a back-and-forth conversation with Tony through Akira.

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Hikaru, Chris, Ed, and Jessica play a hero combat video game using their partner heroes as characters, and Jessica becomes very tired of Hikaru winning all the time. Insisting that such a perfect person like Hikaru must have some weakness, Jessica demands one more round on the game, but the power goes out before they get the chance. Akira had been playing with a mechanical arm and had accidentally cut the power temporarily, but since Hikaru didn't know that he used all the furniture he could to break down the doors on the way to where Akira is located. Hikaru is so worried about Akira's well-being, that he won't even let Tony finish a sentence on being vigilant. Jessica then realizes that Hikaru does have one weakness: he has a one-track mind when he is worried about Akira. Later, Thor tells Hikaru the story of Loki and how he came to be the villain he currently is, stating that it is his responsibility to halt his schemes, not unlike Hikaru's responsibility to take care of Akira. In Jotunheim, Loki announces his anger with how he and his partners are losing progress and decides to handle the next one in person. Both he and the Avengers get the signal for the next DISK, which is located in a chemical plant. In order to get to it, Thor has to use his lightning to power the computer and Iron Man has to hack the password using his armor. Before that can happen, Loki reaches out to Thor and invites him to \"settle the score\" a short distance away. Thor agrees, but Hikaru sees Loki's invitation as a plan to separate Thor from where he is needed and ensure victory. As Tim arrives at the plant, he runs into Iron Man and Thor, whereas the other three Avengers head out to take on Loki. Tim sends out Whiplash, who is defeated by Iron Man and Thor and D-Secured by Akira. Loki manages to evade the other three Avengers, as he and Tim return to Jotunheim. With the DISK recovered, the team heads back to the base, where Jessica still loses to Hikaru in the game despite making him th",

However, when Akira thanks her, she states that it was done solely out of noblesse oblige and has nothing to do with friendship whatsoever. When they arrive, Jessica's parents greet the team, and Akira accidentally breaks a vase. Jessica's parents explain that Jessica's attitude comes from growing up without friends, so she considers them unnecessary. Later, the DISK is revealed to be somewhere in a series of tunnels underground. Akira and Jessica bicker along the way as one ends up saving the other from traps a few times. Eventually, Jessica declares her independence from the rest of the team and storms off, while the rest manage to locate the DISK. They are intercepted along the way by Tim and Doctor Octopus, who manages to disable Iron Man and prevent any other hero from being D-Smashed using his tentacles. Before Jessica can leave, Wasp decides to snap her out of her independent mood swing and tells her that noblesse oblige isn't just about the privileged helping the unprivileged, but also about teammates helping each other. She then returns to the battle scene, D-Smashing Wasp to outmaneuver Doctor Octopus' tentacles and free Iron Man. Together, they take out Doctor Octopus, D-Secure him, and obtain the DISK. Jessica and Akira make amends, then exit the tunnel system together for a treat.",

(Tony specifically decided to take them to the city's scool, Techno Isle International Academy.) As it turns out, they are not alone, as Ōkuma and Riley are also in the city for other purposes. Establishing the double life the kids would have to lead, the Avengers gave them some last-minute advice and pep talks before they officially enroll. The day progresses well for everyone, which includes Akira meeting a girl named Noriko Ashida in a basketball game. As it turns out, Noriko is very impressed by Nozomu's genetic work, and asks Akira to get her copy of Nozomu's research autographed. This is interrupted by Hikaru who approaches and describes how the book and information within it is outdated. Noriko is captivated by Hikaru as he explains the book, but the discussion ends abruptly when Pepper calls in about a disturbance. The alert turns out to be a rampaging Sabretooth, who is destroying many buildings in the urban area of Techno Isle. Ed explains that Sabretooth is different than the villains faced so far, as he is a Mutant. But before he can explain much more, a camera spots a few policemen about to be sliced. Iron Man rescues the policemen and tries to stop Sabertooth, but is defeated. Also, when the rest of the Avengers attempt to take him down with a final strike, Sabretooth's healing factor allows him to shrug off the attacks. The battle scene is then interrupted by Wolverine, who displays how he has found the DISK containing Cyclops. Wolverine expressed his frustration that Tony Stark allowed mutants to be drawn into the conflict, but switched to the matter at hand: A showdown between himself and Sabretooth.",

Seeing as how he wouldn't allow anyone to interrupt his rampage, Sabretooth obliterates one of the Destroyers and sets off after Ōkuma and Riley. Thor advises the Avengers and Wolverine to go all out, since the Destroyers are lifeless husks. Sabretooth threatens Riley since she intervened, but Ōkuma and Manino D-Secure him, noticing that the DISK changed shape due to his mutant nature. Back on the battle scene, the Avengers take down one Destroyer while Wolverine takes down the other with some help from his healing factor. A safe distance away, Iron Man apologizes for what happened to Cyclops and offers Wolverine to join the DISK-securing effort. Wolverine responds with the story of the Sentinels, robots designed by humans to hunt mutants. Wolverine sees the DISKs as the new Sentinels. Pepper tries to explain that history wouldn't repeat itself, but Cyclops had already considered that in the past and had since become living proof that it was false. (Professor X, on the other hand, had stated that changing that was the whole point of the X-Men.) Akira asked why mutants were considered any different than the Avengers, and Tony supported his views on how it was unjustified. That night, Noriko had another dream (she dozed off into one earlier that day) and in that dream she encountered the astral projection of Professor X and abruptly woke up. This distracts her the next day, as she tries to keep up with some tutoring from Hikaru, who she feels enamored to. After a walk, Noriko asks Hikaru if he knows anything about the rumored kids who are supposedly summoning the Avengers. When Hikaru doesn't reply, Noriko asks him to escort her home and keep her safe...after a night on the town.

The battle seems to be going in the favor of the Avengers, but Hikaru is still distracted by thoughts of Noriko, which nearly gets Thor beaten by Thunderball. After Iron Man swears revenge against the Wrecker for his humiliation on the Raft, the Wrecker creates an earth tremor with his crowbar and sends construction equipment falling down. Hikaru doesn't notice, and Chris is forced to pull him out of the way, worring Captain America. The Avengers defeat and D-Secure the Wrecking Crew, but Joel escapes with a new DISK. After seeing that Chris is okay, Captain America starts yelling at him, saying that he is untrained and should leave the difficult stunts to an Avenger. Chris angrily replies saying that they aren't partners like this, and how the Captain only wants to keep himself from reliving the loss of Bucky. Back at the base, Iron Man reveals that he knows Noriko is a mutant, and could possibly use her unique bioelectricity to free the heroes from the DISKs. Hikaru asks Iron Man to wait a while until she's ready, but Iron Man refuses. When they find Noriko later, Iron Man pressures her to help free them, but Noriko lashes out at them feeling betrayed by Hikaru, nearly hitting them with an electric blast.

He also tells her that trust is a big part of being a mutant, and how she really does need people she can rely on. Later that night, Hikaru apologizes to Noriko about the whole deal over coffee, stating how it doesn't matter to him what she is, and Noriko accepts the apology whole-heartedly. Before any more can be said, though, Hikaru is alerted to the fact that Chris is leaving. Hikaru D-Smashes Thor to make his way over, and is silently observed by Ōkuma. Back at the base, Chris is begged by Captain America to stay, asking where he went wrong as a mentor. Chris cuts Captain America off, storms off, and is approached by Thor and Hikaru. Chris explains how he didn't want a mentor to stand above him, he wanted a partner to be alongside. Even Ed's attempt to give Chris a guilt trip didn't stop him from leaving. Later, as the team is discussing how they'd fight without Captain America, Iron Man once again insists on recruiting Noriko, but Hikaru stops him entirely. Pepper interrupts, showing Noriko inside. Noriko announces that she is leaving for the Institute and wanted to stop by one last time first. Before she leaves, though, she decided to try and free everyone from the DISKs once. Noriko is given the DISKs for the remaining Avengers and War Machine, and some time alone in the lab to try and free them. However, while Jessica explains how Noriko wanted Hikaru to stop her from leaving, some smoke starts trailing in from the lab. When they get there, the DISKs (both heroes and captured villains) are missing and there is a big hole in the wall. Elsewhere, Noriko gives the DISKs to Ōkuma as part of a deal, the DISKs for the removal of her powers. However, Ōkuma lied to her, since he really can't remove her powers.

Despite Wolverine's adamantium skeleton being too difficult to pick up, Hikaru attempts to carry Wolverine off to safety. Hikaru's determination to save Noriko and prove useful keeps him going, but the tide of the battle turns hopeless once Cyclops runs out of time and automatically returns to his DISK. Ōkuma approaches Hikaru with a tied-up Noriko and demands the DISKs of not only Cyclops, but also Captain America. Akira, Jessica, and Ed arrive on the scene, and Ed starts praising Zemo to buy some time for Chris to arrive. At an airport security line, Chris finds the DISK for Captain America in his pocket, forcing him to stay in Japan. (During Ed's last-ditch attempt to get Chris to stay the night before, he had snuck the Captain's DISK into Chris' back pocket.) Back by the dojo, Zemo starts to bore of Ed's praise, and Ed runs fresh out of material. Ōkuma asks why any of them would bother to protect mutants like Noriko and Wolverine, saying that they are heartless and untrustworthy monsters. This forces Noriko to respond with an area blast of her bioelectric powers, knocking out Predator X. Noriko doesn't stop her blast, saying that since she's a mutant nothing matters anymore and she should just make everything disappear. However, Hikaru refuses to abandon her, and enters the bioelectric hazard at his own risk to reach out and comfort Noriko. He does so with her, tears in both their eyes, and Noriko's electricity fades away. As Ōkuma is about to D-Secure Noriko herself, Chris arrives and D-Smashes Captain America to deal with Zemo. The two begin to duel, but the Captain lets his anger over Bucky get the better of him and Zemo corners him easily with both his sword and his words, and Zemo knocks away the shield.

Iron Man and Thor express how not capturing Captain America that moment was extremely foolish, but Loki ignores them and proceeds with his plan anyway. Loki reveals a technological chamber containing all the DISKs in his possession, and declares that he plans to use the device to absorb all the powers of heroes and villains alike into his own being, hence becoming all-powerful. The X-Men, kids, and Noriko arrive in Jotunheim via the Blackbird thanks to assistance from Beast, and are ambushed by three Destroyers the second they arrive. The X-Men easily eliminate the Destroyers, but the kids minus Chris feel something happen with their Biocodes right after, as Loki is beginning to drain the power of their partners. To make matters worse, the fallen Destroyers are replaced with three Sentinels, which can overpower the X-Men. Elsewhere, Professor X reaches out to Magneto and appeals to him to save Noriko and the X-Men from the Sentinels, as Magneto could not pass up an opportunity to recruit Noriko himself. Back in Jotunheim, Tim confronts Nozomu in his secluded lab, stating that the device he created was already up and operational despite Nozomu's attempts to sabotage the device. Tim also mentions how the remaining X-Men and Nozomu's sons are cannon fodder to the Sentinels. In the field, Hikaru and Jessica prepare to D-Smash Cyclops and Beast to help deal with the Sentinels, but the X-Men tell them to save their Biocode for later and leave the Sentinels to them. Noriko attempts and fails to use her powers to shut one of the Sentinels down, but it is abruptly lifted into the air as Magneto arrives (Professor X assisted him with Cerebro) and compresses it until it explodes.

This drives Thor to overcome his constant responsibility to stop his brother's scheming while at the same time caring for him, and instead do it by any means necessary. With one final battle cry, the Avengers charge on Loki. Iron Man dodges Loki's initial blasts and follows him skyward, managing to sucker punch him and knock him down to the ground. Iron Man taunts Loki for only using one attack, but Loki manages to get up and hit him with one of his own repulsor blasts. He then proceeds to attack the Avengers with Diamondback's explosive diamonds, and repel Thor's hammer with Juggernaut's armor. It seemed that despite Captain America destroying the device, Tim managed to finish the device's processes at the last second. Hulk charges at Loki, but Loki repels him by splashing him with Diablo's alchemy, once again turning him against the Avengers. However, Ed once again tries to reach out to Hulk, and once again frees him from the alchemic control through their bonds. Hulk knocks Loki into the wall, who then gets up and uses Whirlwind's powers to create a massive tornado. Loki tries to hide in the tornado to stall for time, but Tony tells him he's broadcasting Loki's cowardly ploys onto the internet, and that comments are flooding in full of trash talk against him. Loki eventually loses his patience and removes the tornado.

In his apartment, Deadpool is trying to sell Iron Fist's DISK to Taskmaster, but the other is uninterested in the offer and hangs up on him. Black Widow then calls on Deadpool at his apartment in order to hire him for a mission. Deadpool accepts the payment - after proposing to her. Meanwhile Chris, Captain America, and their S.H.I.E.L.D. escort arrive at Baron Zemo's base, where the villain is to launch the next part of the Red Skull's plan. The group enters through a supposedly unguarded tunnel, but are surprise attacked by the Green Goblin and several HYDRA agents. The S.H.I.E.L.D. agents remain behind to fight the Goblin as Chris is forced to abandon them in order to continue his mission, much to his dismay. When more HYDRA agents corner Chris, Deadpool arrives and saves him. On the surface, Deadpool gives Iron Fist's DISK to Chris, who is still unhappy that he left the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents behind to face the Goblin and HYDRA alone. The three then confront Zemo, who reveals he has brought Hawkeye, in a form of special suspended animation, with him to the base. He threatens to kill the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent if Chris D-Smashes Cap. Unable to condemn Hawkeye to the fate of the other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who brought him to Zemo's base, Chris refuses to D-Smash Cap. Deadpool, unimpressed and angry with Zemo, attacks the villain anyway, receiving grievous injuries his healing factor cannot dissipate quickly because of Zemo's Dimension Sphere-enhanced abilities. When Chris still refuses to D-Smash Cap, Deadpool fires on Hawkeye in order to leave Chris and Cap free to fight. This reveals that the Hawkeye Zemo \"brought\" to his base was an illusion and, finally free to fight, Chris D-Smashes Cap. After a brief battle, Cap and Chris defeat Zemo and destroy the Gaia Anchor - only for Zemo to set off pre-placed land mines on the island before Chris can D-Secure him.",

During his infiltration, Ed receives a call from Pepper, who explains that Chris managed to do a double D-Smash. Ed is surprised as he listens to Pepper explain that the second D-Smashed hero can only remain outside their DISK for a short period of time when the primary hero's DISK time has already run out. Ed takes this into account, then hangs up. Managing to sneak into the base, Ed is spotted by Rebecca Riley, who makes a call. Inside the base, Ed crawls through the air vents, just as he and Jessica did when she received Wasp's DISK. Getting out of the ventilation system, Ed is cornered by the Celebrity Five. Though Hulk asks to be D-Smashed, Ed knows he needs the Hulk to defeat Abomination. Shutting down the Hulk's hologram, Ed tries to fight the CF with a broom - only to learn that they have come to help him defeat the Red Skull, who has enslaved them and made them HYDRA agents. The Five help Ed escape the other HYDRA agents before giving him Power Man's DISK. When Ed then runs in to a door he cannot open, he takes a chance and D-Smashes Power Man, who warms up to him when he sees that Ed possess Hulk's DISK. Power Man then carries Ed through the base on his back, punching through doors - and HYDRA agents - until they reach Abomination and the Gaia Anchor.",

Before she has a chance to tell Hikaru about Falcon's fate, however, the older Akatsuki brother travels too far under ground and his phone looses the signal. Though Thor tries to assure Hikaru that Akira will be safe with Iron Man, the Thunderer's partner remains unsure. In the caves, Hikaru, Thor, and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents find Graviton protecting the last Anchor. After a brief battle, Hikaru uses the Build Uo Plate to increase Thor's power. The two then easily defeat Graviton and destroy the Anchor. Hikaru D-Secures the villain and, when the world doesn't end, the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents cheer in triumph. Back at his base, Red Skull seethes with fury over the Avengers' triumph, then realizes that there may be another way he can win. When Hikaru and Thor go to study shards of a smaller Dimension Sphere that was powering the Gaia Anchor they destroyed, Red Skull arrives. The villain knocks out the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and traps Hikaru in the cavern. He then threatens to injure Hikaru, wondering what the world would think of an Avenger who was unable to protect a child under his care, since Thor has returned to his DISK. Finding the threat does not phase Hikaru, the Skull then threatens to hunt down Akira, which infuriates Hikaru. Red Skull leaves and Hikaru falls to pieces with fear. In a blind panic, Hikaru looks to the shards of the smaller Dimension Sphere. Realizing what he intends to do, Thor warns Hikaru that the Sphere will corrupt him, but Hikaru shuts down his hologram and puts a shard of the mini-Sphere in his heart.",

Tony plans to pretend to fight Thor until they can come up with a more effective counterattack, but Thor will not play along. The fighting becomes more intense as Thor states he cannot let Hikaru kill anyone. Realizing that Thor will continue to protect Hikaru at all costs, the other Avengers vow to protect their young partners as well. The kids look on in horror as the fighting only gets worse. The fight proceeds to wreck the base, scaring the HYDRA agents, who learn from Skull that they and the base are no longer needed. Crossbones emphasizes the point by shooting at one HYDRA agent, scaring him off. Skull then puts the Dimension Sphere into the base's computers and leaves his control room. Skull takes Hikaru to the tank bay where the Avengers are fighting and uses him as leverage to order Thor to kill the other Avengers, while the kids beg their teammates and friends to stop the madness. The Red Skull then suggests to Hikaru that if he used his Build Up Plate, he could destroy the whole team in one shot. Before he can order the boy to do that, however, Crossbones shoots the Skull in the back. Injured, Red Skull realizes that the man behind the mask is not Crossbones. The man confirms this, then takes off the mask and replaces it with a set of sunglasses. Hawkeye then holds up a DISK and states that Crossbones is taking a nap at the moment. Holding the villain at arrow point, Hawkeye tells him to release Hikaru. The Skull smugly admits he cannot - Hikaru is too far gone for anyone to reach. As if to prove the point, Hikaru charges up with Dimension Sphere energy to kill Hawkeye for injuring the Skull. Thor steps in the way of the blast and orders the Avengers not to help him.
