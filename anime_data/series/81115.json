Unlike the previous two films, it will not adapt an existing story (such as StrikerS) but instead feature an original storyline,[2] taking some cue from the plot of The Battle of Aces and The Gears of Destiny but adding original storylines and characters, as well. It is the first part of a two-part story, with the second part titled Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Detonation.\r\n\r\nThe movie was formerly titled Magical Girl Lyrical NANOHA The MOVIE 3rd Reflection, picking up from The MOVIE 2nd A's. On October 2, 2016 (the same day ViVid Strike! went on air), a TV advertisement was released that removed \"The MOVIE 3rd\" from the planned title, to avoid confusion regarding whether the movie is another existing story remake. Nevertheless, it is part of the movie continuity, continuing with the history and designs in The MOVIE 2nd A's. However, as the primary continuity has zero coverage about what has happened between the early spring and winter of 0067,[3] the story of Reflection may somehow be seen as a re-telling or supplement of this blank period.",
