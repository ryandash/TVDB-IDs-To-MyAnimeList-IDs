Meanwhile, Sayaka solves the trapdoor puzzles and descends to the 1st floor before Yumeko and retrieves one of the two lilies. On Yumeko's next turn she also arrives on the 1st floor. However, on the ascent, Yumeko reaches the top first, She had correctly guessed that the outer part of the tower rotated after she opened an outer door, and then used the central staircase to travel down and back up. Having lost by using logic rather than intuition, Sayaka opens one of the outer doors and jumps from the tower. Surprisingly Kirari Jumps as well, grabbing Sayaka as she falls and they both land on a soft safety mat instead of hard ground. Kirari takes pleasure in Sayaka thinking that she was falling to her death, reflecting on their opposing characters, the logician verses her own intuitive nature, and she asks Sayaka to be her secretary again.",
