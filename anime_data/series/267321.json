    "SummaryEnglish": "The story begins in a small town in Pennsylvania in 1838. Jeanie MacDowell is a cheerful and beautiful girl with light brown hair (although this could be perceived as being blonde hair). Jeanie enjoys playing the piano and loves taking piano lessons from her mother.\r\n\r\nSteven, a good harmonica player, and Bill, a boy who is very good at playing the banjo, are great friends of Jeanie's. They enjoy playing music together like a small band.\r\n\r\nHowever, Jeanie's happy life changes dramatically after her mother suddenly passes away.\r\n\r\nExperiencing many difficulties and learning the importance of life, she decides to devote her life to helping many people suffering from illness.\r\n\r\nThe series is a love story about the relationship between Steven and Jeanie - clearly a reference to Stephen Foster and his wife Jeanie.",
