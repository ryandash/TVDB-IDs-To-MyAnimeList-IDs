On the island of Izu Oshima, Akane Isshiki is living a simple life with her sister, Momo, and her grandfather and creator of the engine, Kenjirou. As Akane eagerly awaits the arrival of her classmate, Aoi Futaba, who is travelling to the nearby Blue Island for treatment, she and Momo hear an explosion coming from their home and discover that Kenjirou has somehow switched bodies with an inanimate ferret doll as the result of an experiment. Undeterred by his new form, Kenjirou gives Akane his latest invention, a strange key, in order for her to fight against a strange alien mech, known as an Alone, that is attacking Blue Island, where the Manifestation Engine is stored. As Aoi's transport is hit and crash lands on a ledge, Akane and Kenjirou rush to their location, but Akane is soon struck by her fear of heights that she gained during a traumatic incident. When Aoi starts to fall towards the sea, Akane overcomes her fear and dives after her which activates her key, giving her a special suit known as the Vivid System which stops Akane and Aoi from falling. Kenjirou explains that this system is for Akane and Aoi to fight against the Alone.",

Meanwhile, Kenjirou contacts the head of the Manifestation Engine's management bereau, Yuuri Shij≈ç, in order to gain military support in assisting the girls in fighting the Alone. After knocking out the Alone's core, stopping its movement, Akane and Aoi attempt the Docking Operation, but it fails due to one of them subconsciously rejecting the fusion. As Aoi worries that she might be the one causing it to fail, she thinks back to when she first became friends with Akane, who gave her a tomato on their first meeting. Meanwhile, a mysterious girl fires a glowing arrow into the Alone, bringing it back to life and changing it into a more powerful form. As the girls find their attacks ineffective against the Alone's new form, Aoi confesses to Akane that she actually hates tomatoes, the reason the docking failed being that she didn't want her to find out when their memories combined. Akane tells her that she already knew about that, but admired her perseverence to eat them regardless and assures her they are best friends. Reconfirming their friendship, Akane and Aoi perform the Docking Operation, fusing together to become Vivid Blue and combining their strenths to destroy the Alone. The next day, as Akane, Aoi and Momo discover their school has been obliterated as a result of the battle, Mizuha Amagi, an officer for the National Defense Force, informs them they are being transferred to a new school.",
