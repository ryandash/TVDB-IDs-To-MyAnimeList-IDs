As Akane eagerly awaits the arrival of her classmate, Aoi Futaba, who is travelling to the nearby Blue Island for treatment, she and Momo hear an explosion coming from their home and discover that Kenjirou has somehow switched bodies with an inanimate ferret doll as the result of an experiment. Undeterred by his new form, Kenjirou gives Akane his latest invention, a strange key, in order for her to fight against a strange alien mech, known as an Alone, that is attacking Blue Island, where the Manifestation Engine is stored. As Aoi's transport is hit and crash lands on a ledge, Akane and Kenjirou rush to their location, but Akane is soon struck by her fear of heights that she gained during a traumatic incident. When Aoi starts to fall towards the sea, Akane overcomes her fear and dives after her which activates her key, giving her a special suit known as the Vivid System which stops Akane and Aoi from falling.

Meanwhile, Kenjirou contacts the head of the Manifestation Engine's management bereau, Yuuri Shijō, in order to gain military support in assisting the girls in fighting the Alone. After knocking out the Alone's core, stopping its movement, Akane and Aoi attempt the Docking Operation, but it fails due to one of them subconsciously rejecting the fusion. As Aoi worries that she might be the one causing it to fail, she thinks back to when she first became friends with Akane, who gave her a tomato on their first meeting. Meanwhile, a mysterious girl fires a glowing arrow into the Alone, bringing it back to life and changing it into a more powerful form. As the girls find their attacks ineffective against the Alone's new form, Aoi confesses to Akane that she actually hates tomatoes, the reason the docking failed being that she didn't want her to find out when their memories combined. Akane tells her that she already knew about that, but admired her perseverence to eat them regardless and assures her they are best friends. Reconfirming their friendship, Akane and Aoi perform the Docking Operation, fusing together to become Vivid Blue and combining their strenths to destroy the Alone.

The next morning, Rei goes to Akane's place to apologise for her behaviour the other day and is invited to have dinner with her and Momo. Meanwhile, Kenjirou tells Yuuri about how the Alone are linked to the accident that occurred seven years ago. Rei enjoys the evening as she has dinner, takes a bath and spends the night, and hears from Akane as to why she wanted to become her friend, making a promise that they'll stay friends. The next day, after Rei goes off on her own and Akane and the others are informed of a strategy to pinpoint the source of the arrows, another Alone appears, which Rei powers up with another arrow. Before she can fire anymore however, she is located by security droids and is forced to retreat, allowing Akane and Wakaba destroy the Alone. As Rei becomes cornered, she is discovered by Akane, both becoming shocked upon learning of each other's identities. Jumping to the conclusion that Akane knew her identity from the start, Rei feels betrayed by Akane, believing her wishes of friendship to be a lie, before she is captured by the military.",

Reaching the holding cell, Akane conveys her feelings to Rei, pushing through with her desire to get to know her better. As Rei eventually accepts Akane's feelings, the crow, who reveals her name to be Daivesha, appears before them. Rei reveals her world was destroyed by Manifestation energy, being told by Daivesha that she could bring it back if she destroyed the Manifestation Engine. The whole thing is revealed to be a test by the Alone to see if they are worthy of wielding Manifestation energy. It is revealed that Daivesha had a trap set which would destroy the world if Rei was killed, but Kenjirou had believed in Akane's friendship and avoided that. Just then, Daivesha devours Rei, using the remaining power she had to evolve herself into her ultimate form.",
