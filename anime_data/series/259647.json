After some encouragement by Taichi and Himeko, Iori declines his offer, saying her past mistakes have allowed her to become the person she is now. Afterwards, everyone goes with Iori to see her mother, where they both realise they had both made mistakes trying to make the other happy. After Iori's mother gains the encouragement to turn her ex-husband away, Iori gives thanks to everyone who made her who she is whilst Yui apologises to Chinatsu, promising to meet her at the next karate tournament. As winter vacation comes to an end, Iori starts to question if she truly loves Taichi.",
