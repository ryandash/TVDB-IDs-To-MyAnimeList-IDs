                        "eng": "Izayoi continues to fight against the avatar of the Weser River, the real Pied Piper of Hamelin. Izayoi reveals the others \"were added later, [and were] modeled after Black Plague.\" Weser invites Izayoi to the side of the Demon Lord, but Izayoi declines, causing Weser to attack again. Using Deen, the gift from Rattënfanger, Asuka battles against the enemy's Stroms and wins. Asuka then challenges Ratten to a gift game, to take control of Deen which was under Asuka's control with a single song. Ratten chooses to play the song of illusions, \"The Pied Piper of Hamelin.\" The Sandora and Black Rabbit fight against the demon lord, Black Percher, the embodiment of eighty million evil spirits. Izayoi prods Weser until he uses his ace in their battle. Ratten finishes her song, but it fails to control Deen. She reveals the last blow in their fight was nearly fatal to her and she dissolves into particles of light. Weser also dissolves into light when his article of summoning is broken by Izayoi. The demon lord senses Weser and Ratten's disappearance, and her patience snaps. She declares that she will take Shiroyasha and spreads a dark red wind that kills everyone it touches. A child falls when running away from the deadly wind, and Kasukabe comes to bring her to safety, but is still injured and is temporarily immobilized. Asuka blocks the wind from reaching them with Deen to allow their escape. Black Rabbit transports the fighters to the Moon Palace, the Chandra Mahal. Asuka, who has the ability to bring out the full potential in a gift, uses the Spear of Indra to defeat Black Percher. After the battle, Asuka meets with the members of Rattënfanger, and is left in charge of Deen and Merun. Izayoi notes that Salamandra had invited the Demon Lord to the festival to concrete Sandora's claim to her position. The \"No-Names\" attempt to re-fertilize their land. A letter floats down from the sky above Izayoi.",
