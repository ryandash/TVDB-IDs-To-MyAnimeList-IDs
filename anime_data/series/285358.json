The next day, as Momiji becomes determined to learn how to snap her fingers for a salute, she takes Haneru's lessons more seriously and manages to jam well with just isolation moves. After seeing Jey's moves, however, she decides she can't match up to him and quits dancing, but not before learning to snap her fingers. Before leaving for the mountains, Momiji explains how she felt an ominous aura.",
