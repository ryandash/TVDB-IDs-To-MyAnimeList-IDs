    "SummaryEnglish": "A Japanese anime adaptation of the 1844 novel The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas. The series preserves much of the novel's plot and characters but reimagines the story in the far future and adds a number of fantastical twists. Set in the year 5053, the story focuses on the mysterious, social-climbing Count, who is really a sailor named Edmund Dantes who was betrayed by his friends and imprisoned on false charges. Aided by a mysterious force dubbed 'Gankutsuou', he escaped prison and has now refashioned himself as the Count, determined to exact vengeance on those who wronged him.",
