One of the members is then called to battle aboard an enemy ship. She successfully infiltrates the ship and disarms the Captain. The situation is disrupted by a UFO passing too close to both ships. When the same member comes to, the enemy captain detonates the ship.\r\n\r\nLater, during a memorial service for one of his ancestors, Kio Kakuzu finds a cat-like alien sitting at the buffet table. The alien introduces herself as Elis, and the two have a short conversation before Kio accidentally drinks beer and passes out. The next morning, Kio wakes up with a hangover and finds Elis sleeping half naked next to him in bed. Kio's startled cry wakes her up, and she heals his hangover with a handheld device.\r\n\r\nManami Kinjō and Maki Itokazu then visit Kio, and upon seeing Elis half naked and with cat ears and a tail, they misinterpret the situation, thinking that Kio brought a girl home and forced her to cosplay all night. After discovering that Elis is an alien, they both abruptly leave without saying why. Kio goes on a walk to gather his thoughts and runs into Aoi Futaba, who asks Kio on a date. Aoi is interupted by a man in a car who she names as her Uncle. He offers her a ride home.\r\nIt is later revealed that Manami is in recruiting to become part of the CIA, Aoi is a Momiji for the Immigration Bureau of Japan, and Itokazu is the leader of an organization of SF fans called \"Beautiful Contact\", and they are all given orders to eliminate Elis.",

She then moves to kill Elis, but Kio begs the Momiji (not knowing it is Aoi) to spare her. She obliges, but as soon as she leaves, Manami appears with CIA back-up, knocks Kio out and captures Elis, but not before Kio sees Manami's watch and knows it is her.\r\n\r\nLater, Kio confronts Manami and begs her to help him find Elis. Manami contacts Aoi for extra help, and, receiving help from his uncle, Kio blackmails Itokazu and Beautiful Contact into helping as well. Together, they succeed in breaking into the military compound where Elis has been given to the DIA, only to find that she has already broken herself out.\r\nThe episode ends with the rest of the Catian fleet appearing over the city, announcing their existence and their intent to negotiate a treaty with the Japanese government, as a result of Elis submitting a report about grilled beef.",

They state their intention to leave, since the events of the previous episode marked them as traitors to their respective factions. Elis tells them that since Kio's house is now a Catian embassy, everyone inside is protected by Catian laws, and the two girls are invited to live there as well.\r\n\r\nLater, while the robotic servants are on guard duty and Manami and Aoi are bathing together, one of the robots is abducted by members of a yet unknown faction. Manami and Aoi spring into action, rescuing the robot, although the intruders escaped by use of a stun grenade. The next morning, Manami, Aoi, and Kio are hired by Elis as official embassy employees.\r\n\r\nManami discovers Aoi's feelings for Kio, and offers to help her out, though Manami's reactions throughout the episode lead Aoi to suspect that she may have feelings for him as well.",

Dr. Dyureru appears and explains that Elis will soon be going into heat, causing her to have heightened senses, and congratulates Elis on having a mating partner on her first heat, much to Manami's outrage and Kio's embarrasment. She also assigns Elis a mission to go into Tokyo and \"observe the human economy, technology, and culture\", which, according to Elis, means to bring back a bunch of toys and games as souvenirs.\r\n\r\nOn the train back, members of Underside of Kitten Paw separate Elis and Kio from Manami and Aoi, putting them to sleep and showing the sleeping Elis live to the screaming fans of Underside of Kitten Paw.",

After eating, they decide to escape, but to their dismay Elis' power suit has been limited due to Elis being in heat. They are taken to a play room with Antonia who is dressed like a giant AssistDroid. Kio notes that all of the video games have been fixed to only accommodate one player, due to the maids not having the heart either to beat their master in a game nor lose intentionally.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Aoi and Manami visit a weapons store and stock up. While there, they ask for a motor boat and are told the only one was sold to Director Kawasaki for his upcoming film. The girls infiltrate the set and rig the boat with real weapons, but they are caught by Kawasaki, who contracts them into his film. After being forced into Playboy-like costumes, Aoi and Manami steal the boat and break into the yacht to find that Kio and Elis have switched clothes, enabling Kio to use the power suit's strength-enhancing capabilities. They are stopped by Antonia and one of her maids, but Kio convinces Antonia to let them go. Antonia offers them escape in the emergency sea plane.\r\nAoi sabotages the ship's engines, but is caught by an agent of Dogisia, who is destroying the ship in the hopes that it will take Elis with it.

They decide that Elis looks too human, and instead ask her if they could use her ship or her robots. The footage of the ship looks like it is being held by strings due to its design, and the robots look more like chibi dolls. They decide to go for a romance film. Upon hearing this, Elis' hormones go berserk and she assaults Kio, something she has done several times earlier anytime something one has said sounds similar to romance or sex.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Aoi wants to practice cooking to impress Kio, but due to her frequent failures she wastes a lot of food. At the same time, Manami wants to practice shooting, but she can't do it in Kio's backyard. Chaika takes them to a virtual room on board the mothership, where they can fulfill their respective desires without it bothering anyone. She also makes it a point that the Catia without mates use it to satisfy their sexual desires during heat and offered if they would like to try it out as well, much to the girls' embarrassment. Aoi asks for a Kio to be her taste-tester. Manami asks for a shooting gallery with a wide assortment of weaponry, and for an M134 Minigun in particular, which turns out to be too heavy for her to lift. She asks for a Kio to help her lift it, who tells her in a very Kio-like manner that he can't lift it. Manami asks virtual-Kio what he thinks of various people, eventually ending up on herself. He confesses that he once had feelings for her, but when he heard she was hanging out with Jack (unaware this was her female CIA handler), he thought she was already dating someone and she ended up being just a friend.\r\n\r\nBack at home, Aoi gives the real Kio a taste of a recipe she \"perfected\" with virtual-Kio, only to find out that virtual-Kio had lied to make Aoi feel good about her cooking.

Kio's club-mates ask him if he is going to the film camp, and asks Elis if she would like to go on the trip as well. As a result, Elis, Antonia, Aoi, Manami, and Antonia's maids all become members of the film club with the intention of going to the camp.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a group of Dogisian AssistDroids are robbing surrounding areas of electronic equipment, due to their inability to self-repair. The Dogisian ambassadors reveal a specially made AssistDroid that closely resembles a Catian AssistDroid.\r\nOnce at the camp, Antonia offers Elis a number of high-end swim suits for her to wear. When the other girls inquire about all of the ones that Elis refuses, Antonia allows them to wear the ones Elis doesn't like. Later, when they are all showing off their expensive swim suits, the girls realize to their dismay that they have all had holes cut in the rear to accommodate Elis' tail, due to one of the girls mistakenly wearing her bottom piece backwards. At dinner, Kio asks if he can talk to Aoi about something in private, but ends up asking if she can teach him to fight. Once alone, Aoi realizes that she is out of her league in the running for Kio. Elis appears, and Aoi takes out her frustration on her. Suddenly a young girl named Ichika appears, and at the same time, the camp gets attacked by the Dogisian AssistDroids.
