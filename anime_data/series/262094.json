Alibaba then agrees to help them without the military's help and Hakuryuu reveals that he can track down the pirates by a seed infused with his magic which he has hidden inside their loot. Meanwhile, Aladdin is introduced by the pirates leader Aum Madaura who claims that the children are better under her care then living in poverty with their families, but he refuses to believe her.

When the medium seriously hurts Kouen and Alibaba, Kouen's brothers combine their efforts to deal a sequence of powerful attacks at it, ultimately dropping it into the ocean, which backfires when it empowers itself by draining the Rukh from the sea. Back at the Kou palace, Gyokuen watches in awe the whole battle, reminiscing the time when she was one of Solomon's Magi at Alma Torran before betraying him. Exhausted by the continued battle, Aladdin and the others little can do to stop the medium as it starts pulling Il Irah from the heavens, when Sinbad appears to assist them, accompanied by Drakon, Yamraiha and the other King Vessels from the Alliance of the Seven Seas. Surprised with their sudden appearance, Aladdin is informed by Sinbad that they were previouly warned of the situation by Yunan and Morgiana, who also appear to join the battle against the medium as well.",

In a last effort to destroy the medium, Sheherazade sacrifices herself to reinvigorate the weary King Vessels with the last of her magoi and all dungeon capturers join forces to attack it with all their might at once. However, the medium survives the blow, but Aladdin glimpses a small light inside the giant making it hesitate. Certain that it must somehow related to Titus and Mogamett, the Magi uses the Solomon's Wisdom to reach them, accompanied by Yamraiha who also wants to reunite with her foster father. The two find Mogamett being conforted by Titus' Rukh and the chancellor reveals his regret for all the troubles he caused and all the people that he forced to fall into depravity in order to create the medium. In the occasion, it is revealed that Yamraiha was kidnapped from the Royal Palace in Musta'sim when she was a child and raised by him, but she claims that she does not regret it at all and he will always be a father to her. Mogamett then decides to depart to the Great Flow of Rukh, after asking Aladdin to look for a way to redeem those who had fallen into depravity and return them to the White Rukh as well. As the medium collapses, Gyokuen rejoices as despite failing to bring forth Il Irah this time, the medium had weakened the boundaries between worlds, and another medium may bring its advent immediately once completed. Meanwhile at the great palace, Ugo greets Sheherazade and offers her a chance to reincarnate as a Magi but she allows Titus to do so in her place. The Kou Empire then turns their attention to the conquest of Magnostadt, but Sinbad declares that Sindria and its allies had joined forces with the Reim Empire and he will take custody of the country for the sake of its reconstruction.
