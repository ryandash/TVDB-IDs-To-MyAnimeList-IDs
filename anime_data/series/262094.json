Impressed with Mogamett's speech, the students start opening up to his views except for Aladdin and Titus. Some time later, Mogamett asks Titus to take him to Marga in the 5th district where he allows the girl to live with him at the surface. Aladdin accompanies them as well and realizes that Mogamett does not view the non-magicians as humans anymore and fears that it will eventually lead everyone to ruin. Marga is then examined and Mogamett reveals that while she can't be cured of her condition, her life can be saved, much to Titus' relief. Meanwhile, Aladdin has classes with High Magician Irene Smirnoff, who displays her experiments with Black Rukh and confirms his suspicions that Magnostadt is somehow connected to Al-Thamen. Back at his home, Titus is informed by Sheherazade that his mission is accomplished and is ordered to return home, but he turns to Mogamett for help instead, as just like Marga, he does not have much time left to live.",

After explaining the situation to Aladdin, Mogamett is inquired by him about his connection with Al-Thamen and reveals that he and his companions once allied with Ithnan and together, they developed the Dark Metal Vessels but severed ties with them after learning that they entrusted the vessels to non-magicians including Dunya.

Perceiving that the magicians' weapon is draining the Magoi of the citizens of the 5th district to the death, Aladdin destroys the cables that power it before flying to the frontlines where Mu defeats Titus and urges him to accompany back home until the young Magi arrives and asks for their cooperation to end the war for everyone's sake.",

Aladdin also reveals that this is Al-Thamen's ultimate objective and it must be prevented at all costs. After agreeing with a cease fire, Sheherazade reveals that her young body is a clone of her original, aging body just like Titus and allows him to spend the rest of his days with his friends, as her original body is almost perishing, and when that happens, all her clones will die as well.

Despite fully equipping his Djinn Leraje, Kouha fights to the exhuastion because the monsters keep regenerating and urges his forces to retreat, but the soldiers refuse to comply out of their loyalty to him.
