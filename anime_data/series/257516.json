On the next day, Kuroyukihime introduces Haruyuki to the Brain Burst program that allows users to \"accelerate\" their brain waves to make time appear to stand still. Araya, having been provoked by Kuroyukihime, throws a punch at Haruyuki, but before the punch lands the burst link is activated. While in accelerated mode, Kuroyukihime advises Haruyuki to let the punch land and to throw himself at her so that Araya would be caught on the security camera in front of several witnesses, which Haruyuki agrees to do. After exiting burst link mode, Haruyuki does exactly that and Araya is detained by security. On the way home from school, Haruyuki and Chiyuri meet up with Takumu Mayuzumi and Haruyuki runs home alone after believing that Takumu was informed about what happened during lunch. On the next day, Haruyuki connects to the Global Net to check that he has his lunch money against Kuroyukihime's orders and on his way to school, he is transported into a war-torn world where he transforms into Silver Crow and is challenged by Ash Roller to a duel.",

When Kuroyukihime offers to let Haruyuki return to his normal life, Haruyuki declines stating that he owes her for changing his life. Having agreed to further his friendship with Kuroyukihime, she orders him to learn how to fight. After linking out, Kuroyukihime explains to the students in the dining room that she asked Haruyuki to go out on a date and he rejected it, much to everybody's surprise. After school, Haruyuki challenges Ash Roller to a rematch and forms a strategy using the information given by Kuroyukihime. Haruyuki starts off with a surprise attack with the intent to stall until time ran out, but Ash Roller obtained the ability to climb walls on his motorcycle making that strategy impossible. A desperate Haruyuki attempts his killer move, the headbutt, but instead he is rolled over by the motorcycle. Haruyuki then figures out Ash Roller's weakness and lifts the rear wheel off the ground to immobilize Ash Roller since the motorcycle is a rear wheel drive model from the 20th century. Haruyuki headbutts Ash Roller at close range to win the duel.

Brain Burst was anonymously created seven years ago which allows acceleration only to those who were born with the Neurolinker. Therefore, all Burst Linkers are children age 15 and younger, allowing its existence to be concealed from the public. Kuroyukihime wants to meet the creator to learn the purpose of the program. To do that, she needs to reach level 10, which requires five wins over level 9 Burst Linkers and one defeat results in the permanent uninstallation of Brain Burst. Two years ago, Kuroyukihime was one of the Kings of Pure Color, a group of level 9 Burst Linkers that agreed to not fight each other, but she did not agree to the treaty and beheaded the Red King, causing her to be branded a traitor and leading her to seal away Black Lotus. Since then, she has stayed offline, only logging on to the school's local net with a dummy avatar. Recently, she was challenged to a duel by a Burst Linker named Cyan Pile, which could lead to her identity as Black Lotus being exposed. Thus, she must find Cyan Pile's identity. She suspects Chiyuri, which is why she provoked her, although Haru doubts it knowing that Chiyuri is bad at games. Haru begins the investigation by going to Chiyuri's home under the pretense of apologizing for lunch the other day. The two link up with each other with an extremely short cable and reconcile with each other, with Chiyuri letting Haru know that Takumu was not told about the bullying. During the conversation, Haru discovers that while Chiyuri is not Cyan Pile, there is a back door connection that could lead to finding its identity.",

As Kuroyukihime and Haru walk together that day, Haru resides himself to just being a pawn, prompting a slap from her. Just then, an out of control car heads straight towards Haru and Kuroyukihime, prompting them to go into the Accel World. As Kuroyukihime confesses to Haru that she is love with him, she uses a powerful move which causes her Brain Burst to drop to lower levels, allowing her to manipulate her body in the Accel World to push Haru out of the way of the car, leading to only her being hit. As Kuroyukihime is taken into intensive care, Haru comes to realise that if she was to be attacked by a Burst Linker now, she would be completely vulnerable, and so chooses to stay the night. As the morning comes, Haru spots Takumu coming into the hospital and comes to realise that he is the true Cyan Pile. With just a split second to act, Haru rushes to challenge Takumu to a Brain Burst match before he can challenge Kuroyukihime.",

As the training begins, Raker first tasks Haru with climbing up the large tower where Raker's abode is, which proves difficult when the changing field turns the tower into metal. However, Haru soon starts to use his will power to learn how to pierce into the metal, also taking into consideration what Kuroyukihime told him about his speed. On the 7th day, Haru finally puts what he had learnt to practise and reaches the top of the tower.
