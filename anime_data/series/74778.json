                    "SummaryEnglish": "If Raph, Goodwin and Sara can destroy Mallos as a human, they can stop him from ever existing as a demon. Ironically, by destroying Mallos, they set forth the very pattern that allowed him to make his \"\"deal with the devil\"\" and become a demon in the first place. With the help of an eccentric local (misunderstood) wizard, our heroes return to modern time to discover the devil's thousand year reign is about to begin. The key to stopping it rests on finding Raphael's missing child. In addition, this episode introduces KARAZAK, Mallos' demonic rival.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "While strolling along on the beach, discussing their future, Rafe, Sara and Goodwin discover the teenaged Kiyomi lying on the sand. She has no memory of anything that happened to her since her disappearance 3 centuries ago. Meanwhile, Mallos and a resurrected Vashista are lurking nearby. Apparently Mallos' Millennia Plan require that he marry the Immortal's daughter. Vashista raised the girl in the Beyond, and still has motherly feelings toward her. She tries to come to an arrangement with Rafe: he kills Mallos and she gets Kiyomi. Kiyomi is eventually lured to the abandoned building where the wedding is to take place, and Rafe is captured. Sara and Goodwin sneak in, and Vashista ultimately turns over a wedding-gowned dummy to Mallos and frees Raphael. In a final battle, Rafe sends Mallos back to Hell and recovers his daughter. However, as the episode ends, Vashista shows up and warns that the arrangement is only temporary.",
