        "eng": "Lua is a saintess candidate who possesses the power of healing. But her ability had one flaw: she could only heal others by transferring their wounds onto herself. Because of this, others bullied her, calling her the \"Fallen Saintess.\" But it didn't bother Lua because her best friend Arianne always stood up for her.\r\n\r\nOne day, Lua's crush, Commander Garrett, was on the brink of death from a beast attack. Lua healed him, which left her on the verge of death. When she woke up, she learned that all the credit was given to Arianne, and she finally saw her best friend's true color. Devastated, Lua is lost and helpless when the second prince appears in front of her with a tempting offer. What would happen to Lua as she begins her new life as a villainess?",
        "jpn": "治癒の力を持つ聖女候補のルーア。しかし彼女の能力には欠点があり、症状を自分に移して治癒するため、自身に痛みや苦しさが伴うものだった。時に「欠陥聖女」と蔑まれたが、いつも庇ってくれる親友アリアンの存在に助けられていた。だがアリアンには隠された“裏の顔”があり、ルーアを絶望に陥れる。「私はもう誰も癒したりしない」そう誓ったルーアの元に、突然第二王子スウェンが現れ、「一緒に復讐をしないか？」と持ちかけてきて――。彼女は隠していたもうひとつの能力を使い、スウェンと手を組んで“聖女”ではなく“悪女”として新しい人生を始める…！！"
