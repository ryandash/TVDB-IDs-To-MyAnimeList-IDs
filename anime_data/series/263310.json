Wanting to help out, Akari joins Ichigo and the others in their first strategy meeting, where they decide to make a song to fit their theme of a bright future. Following Naoto's suggestion, Ichigo, Aoi, and Ran meet up with an artist named Kanon about writing their new song. Kanon is initially uncertain as she's never written a song about other people before, but becomes interested after seeing their performance, spending the day getting to know them and agreeing to write their song. The next day, Ichigo becomes downhearted when Mizuki turns down her offer to be on stage with her, stating she is thinking about retiring as an idol. When Kanon presents her new song, Ichigo feels it needs something to express her gratitude towards Mizuki, to which Kanon makes some revisions. On the day of the event, as Ichigo grows concerned as to whether Amahane will finish her new Premium Dress on time, Akari goes off in search of Mizuki in order to get her to see Ichigo's performance. Meanwhile, as Kaede, Sakura, and Yurika try to get the Premium Dress in time for Ichigo's performance, Aoi, Ran, and Sora try to extend the concert's drama segment for as long as possible to buy enough time for them to return. With cards in hand and Mizuki in the audience, Ichigo presents the song that Kanon wrote for her and conveys her feelings towards Mizuki who, along with Akari, joins her in an encore performance. After the concert, Ichigo surpasses Mizuki on the top idol ranking, encouraging Mizuki to keep on going as an idol and giving Akari her crystal mic, before joining the others in celebration.",

After searching through countless shrines, the girls find the location of the tree, only to learn it was cut down following a typhoon. Thanking the girls anyway, Ikuyo rewards Otome with a ring that she was given after being turned down.
