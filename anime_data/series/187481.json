    "SummaryEnglish": "It has been three years since little Katri's mother left for Germany leaving her daughter behind in Finland, where she now lives with her grandparents. With Finland still under Russian domination, the inhabitants of these lands have had little or no news from the outside and no one knows if little Katri will again see her mother. To make matters worse, things in the Katri's grandparents' farm are not going well, the harvest had been a small one, their only cow had been killed by a bear and the family confronts great monetary problems. Katri wants to help and finds work in a neighboring farm; for a girl of hardly nine years of age the work of a farm is hard and tiring even with all of her enthusiasm and good moods, which is what keeps her standing.",

A cowpoke's cautionary challenge becomes the forum by which Sara explains that she has had to work abroad for protracted periods of time as evidenced by her previous visit having taken place the year before -- a dynamic that has driven Katri to perch on a bridge railing oblivious to how worried her grandparents Hilda and Julius Ukonniemi are about her. A very sentimental mother-daughter reunion gives way to Katri exchanging notes with Sara about the lives they have led before Sara presents Katri her payload -- an energetic dachshund puppy. Katri becomes extremely fond of the dachshund puppy which she names Aapeli whose immense affection and situational utility does very little to compensate for Sara's protracted absence during which the Colossal War in Europe extinguishes all correspondence and finding to her horror that her grandparents' micro-economy is in a bad way even without a large bear that thinks of Katri and her grandparents as food before Aapeli barks some trepidation into the large ursine. Even as the male villagers slay the bear that they think is why another farm lost two cows and Aapeli barks an injunction against proximity to the forest to the calf, it ultimately offers very cold comfort to Katri who does not like the necessity of selling a cow that she is fond of -- and that a bear has decided for the cow being its next meal along with her grandpa.",

Much to Katri's anguish, a bear has killed Juura's mother and damaged the family micro-economy to the point where Katri gives some serious thought to offering her labor to the other farmers -- the divergent concourse thereof inflaming the aftermath of Katri's grandfather having damaged himself even more by going in the sauna. While Katri's attempt the next morning to make her case of offering her labor to the other farmers to him is unsuccessful, Julius does acknowledge the money problems of the farm but would rather see Katri fulfill the much grander plans he has for her. Upon setting course to appraise Juura's status, Katri coming upon a schoolboy named Martti playing hooky from school ultimately becomes the genesis for the two kids' The grass is greener on the other side exchange of personal perspectives that branches into a demonstration of Aapeli's great situational utility in herding animals and a lucrative friendship -- if Martti succeeds in finding a job for Katri.",

While Julius compares notes with his wife Hilda about Martti and how to weather the storm ahead, Martti and Katri begin their angler outing oblivious to the deteriorating weather conditions building above them which forces the two kids to take shelter in a cave when their boat is swept from its mooring; now marooned on the island, Martti finds the courage to explain Katri a significant ethical issue of his family employing her before resolving to gather data from the commerce his family prosecutes. Aapeli rises to the occasion as the ultimate skeleton key to Katri and Martti successfully forestalling hypothermia prior to Julius's arrival on the island; unfortunately, Julius arrives too late to proactively forestall Katri and Martti catching a cold as a memento of the ordeal.",

Upon Katri and Julius expounding on several instances of Aapeli's situational utility, the cobbler sees things their way and agrees to write the requisite recommendation letter. As if to help ultimately seal the deal, Aapeli even gets into the act to once again demonstrate his situational utility when he takes the initiative to assume responsibility for Governor Halme's horse catalyzed by Katri's direction; after being mistaken for a cattle thief, Martti is elated upon learning the epilogue Katri has had visited unto her -- a new job within a week and Ukonniemi-ke being bailed 15 liters of wheat courtesy of a contrite Governor Halme.",

A chance encounter with the cobbler becomes the forum for Katri to have delivered unto her a syllabus of what to expect from Räikkölä-ke prior to Martii catching up to Katri; upon having explained the cobbler's counsel, Martii feels a little guilty about how things have turned out as he endures the physiological wages of the subterfuge that he has had to avail. After taking a recess for lunch, Katri and Martii find that passing through a nearby village is easier said than done when they are accosted by a quartet of boys that take an unethical interest in the dachshund; when it becomes apparent that the boys will not listen to Aapeli's Leave me alone!!! growls complete with a defensive chomp, Martii renders unto Katri his greatest parting gift: stalemating the bullies so that she can escape. The bullies repulsed and Martii sent off back to Halme-ke is ultimately cold comfort to Katri and Aapeli literally running on fumes as their re-affirmation of their course for Räikkölä-ke becomes the genesis of their initial encounter with a cowpoke from Penttilä named Pekka whose courier intercession carries with it enduring his crass comedy as the salary; as the proximity to Räikkölä-ke increases, so will the necessity of Katri acknowledging the hefty syllabus ahead of her.",

Katri's confusion is only compounded when she finds the estate governess Ulla Räikkölä in the sauna making hotcakes apparently unable to focus on anything about her other than her fondness for Aapeli who has come upon a doghouse built near Katri's quarters perfect for housing the dachshund if Katri can get the estate governor Teemu Räikkölä to see things her way when he returns -- easier said than done when Teemu is in a bad mood and Aapeli is less than diplomatic with his volition for the doghouse!!! The ensuing caustic denigration of Aapeli is ultimately perverted to Teemu's detriment when Aapeli helps Katri to account for each and every cow during the cattle drive tomorrow; however, Teemu charging Katri flawless memorization of individual names and attributes proves far more daunting.",

Katri's destination is Ulla's friend Kivi who had promised to isolate a quantity of swedes for Ulla to make a small bumper crop; even as Katri makes her volition clear for the commerce rather than conversation and prosecutes her return commute with the payload, Viikuna decides to explore around the cliff in spite of Aapeli's protests against it -- especially when the other cows decide to follow Viikuna's lead!!! It ultimately takes a collaborative effort alongside Pekka complete with some strategic counsel involving all the cows' names to successfully effect a rescue; unfortunately, a flawless survivor ratio is of null utility against the enraged Teemu who cares nothing that Katri was only complying Ulla's orders!!!",

Martii decides for a visit to Katri as the method of choice for initiating his summer furlough along with introducing his disdainful cousin Helena who leaves in a huff; Katri's physiological deviant diagnostic now confirmed, Martii decides to intercede on Katri's behalf by herding the cattle prior to explaining Teemu the necessity of Katri resting for a few days -- an enterprise interdicted by Katri's obstinacy and Teemu not really understanding the full nature of the situation. Fortunately for Katri, Teemu cannot ignore the warm sensation of a fever nor the sincerity with which Martii promises to cover for Katri during this time; in spite of Teemu's qualms about his suitability for the job for which his punctual arrival should be a factor, Martii sets out to guide the cattle to the pasture but finds that Viikuna is not as easily appeased at the substitution of supervision as she decides for exploring the forest before Pekka makes her reverse course back to the herd. What everybody fails to realize is that Ulla is about to prosecute the ultimate course reversal as the many parallels between Leena's demise and Katri's illness prompt her to set course for the sauna to synthesize hot cakes, while Katri divides her energies between feeding her face and computing a perspective of Ulla having done such a selfless thing for her, Martii finds that securing Helena's cooperation is more difficult than forestalling a migration into danger led by Viikuna!!!",

Katri becomes the genesis of analytical and speculative expository concourse that evening when Pekka comes to Räikkölä-ke to appraise Katri's status and reflects on his prologue with Katri while Teemu and Ulla compare perspectives of the situation along with possible solutions if there is no improvement; while this is nothing insignificant in its own right, it is quite tame compared to when Helena objurgates Martii regarding the exhaustive epilogue of having to chase wayward bovines all day while predicting that he will require the entire next day in order to recuperate. What ultimately ensues is not exactly Helena's prediction but a close second -- Martii oversleeping the next morning and having to power-row across the lake to Räikkölä-ke against Helena's protests and threats to blow the whistle; what Helena overlooks is that while Martii is not being exactly honest and open with it, it is an act of absolute integrity and maturity to keep a promise.",

Unfortunately, poor Martii has to endure running on fumes as a consequence of power-rowing across the lake on an empty stomach due to having overslept through breakfast; if that is not enough, a power nap after an impromptu brunch becomes the backdrop for a thunderstorm to unexpectedly roll in the necessity of having to grapple with the cows toward the shelter of the forest. Upon Helena having explained it to him, Governor Halme is none too pleased at his son's choice of summer employment and heads out to express this perspective; meanwhile, it becomes glaringly apparent that Martii is absolutely in over his head when a ground-bound lightning strike panics several of the cows into running away deeper into the woods. Caring nothing of Martii's exhaustion from having to retrieve the absconding bovines and that Martii is in over his head, Pekka objurgates Martii's irresponsibility for leaving the cows unattended during a thunderstorm at which Martii snaps and gives Pekka a far more ferocious run for his money than his aristocratic appearance would suggest possible!!!

The silver lining this time around is that all the bovines in the herd have acclimated themselves to Katri; as if to congratulate her on recovering from her illness and becoming one of the herd, Viikuna decides to behave herself and lead the herd in giving Katri plenty of down time. Resolved to defeat her scheme of hiding Martii, Helena decides to pay Katri a rather rude visit criticizing the partially completed basket only to have Pekka ambush her with the perspective that Martii has not been in the area; Martii is actually at a nearby lake prosecuting a bountiful angler's adventure that he hopes to share with Katri who has decided on having her lunch break. Unfortunately, Martii and Pekka have not completely resolved their differences from when the cows ran away because of the thunderstorm; just as Martii and Pekka are about to throw down, Katri protests that this testosterone tussle will cost both boys their friendship with her -- along with the three fish Martii caught. The only seventh heaven that is ultimately greater than seeing Martii and Pekka bury the hatchet is when Martii agrees to do what he can to expand Katri's library; right on the heels of that promise, Ulla arrives to deliver Katri a courtesy copy of her mother's letter from Frankfurt along with a letter from Julius and Hilda that both indicate all systems go! on the homefront and to encourage her to hang in there for another year.",

Upon Pekka sharing his perspective of books being a headache for him, Katri remarks about the complicated portions that make sense with a little computation in most cases when Aki posing the question of what Pekka and Katri plan to do with their lives becomes the preamble of his discourse about the feeling of national pride galvanizing the Finnish people as they prepare to fight for their political independence from Russia; an impromptu tutoring session with Aki gives way to Teemu giving Katri a day off as thanks for Ulla's recovery. Martii arrives the next day with the news that Julius and Hilda are doing well for themselves along with that he has secured some books for Katri to read; while Pekka digests the food for thought of Martii playing with Aapeli, Martii returns back home to find Aki sending off his mother on her journey back to Turku. Upon hearing that Katri has Sunday off and realizing that Katri is not going to enjoy being around Helena, Aki suggesting that Martii and Katri spend time with him at his villa becomes the ultimate backdrop for the two kids to learn that insulting criminal laws with destructive conduct is not the only route to being arrested . . . the sole prerequisite is to gently rock the boat; much to Martti and Katri's horror, Aki's political activities are making the prospect of capsizing in a heavy storm an imminent and intimidating prospect for the Russians!!!",

Pekka explaining Martii the presence of multiple pastures igniting a fast friendship between the two boys obfuscates Katri endeavoring to understand why Aki had been arrested as she holds the Kalevala in her hand -- the quandary that becomes the forum for Martii to deliver Katri the bad news. Viikuna's curiosity punctuates Martti and Katri's personal perspective comparison exercise before Martii's cousin Helena arrives to relay that the departure time has been moved up along with taking one last contemptuous dig at Katri. An upcoming thunderstorm becomes the ultimate forum for Katri to receive a new dress from Ulla along with the opportunity to some spend more time with Martti; as an unexpected bonus, Katri is also blessed with courier commerce courtesy of Martti who is combining efforts with Pekka to mind the herd.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "An ordinary afternoon of minding the herd on the north pasture where Katri feels that she can work on reading the Kalevala without having an incident on her hands becomes the preamble for a novel discovery -- neither Viikuna leading the other cows over the cliff nor Aapeli giving chase after a curious fox -- but rather a lost lamb grazing on the pasture that Pekka denies is a Penttilä asset. Katri leading the cattle back to the Räikkölä farm sets the stage for a soliloquy about the climate patterns of Finland whose most prominent feature Aapeli demonstrates as he repels a pack of hungry wolves stalking the herd during the home commute -- forest fauna not being as reluctant to venture into the open. Back at the ranch, the little lamb quickly becomes the talk of the town when Katri has it explained that she will most likely end up as the sheep's owner considering the circumstances defined by Teemu who gives Katri the syllabus of her duties the next day where she unsuccessfully tries to emulate the bundling techniques of the adults. Ulla brings lunch out to everybody and signals an interest in having Aapeli's company while out on the town but finds that the dachshund is more interested in catching the fox that previously eluded him. Unfortunately, for Katri, Aapeli is ultimately not the only one with a score to settle as the pack of wolves Aapeli repelled earlier decide to try for the sheep in spite of Katri's fierce opposition; a lengthy battle and a nocturnal escort home courtesy of Vihtori later, Katri enjoys a hearty and well-earned meal after reading a letter that Martti has decided to apply himself academically.",
