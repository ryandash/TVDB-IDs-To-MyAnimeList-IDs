At the thought of this, he immideately killed the her. He wasn't alone. He has Sanzo, Hakkai and Goku with him now. He then proceed to climb the stairs and finally reaching the top, he met Kami-sama.\r\n\r\nIn another scene we see Hakkai, Sanzo and Goku going up the stairs, led by the hyper-energetic saru. As they were on their way, they saw Gojyo walking down the stairs. Being angry at Gojyo's treatment to them, the three decide to give him a welcoming 'bash'.

Now that the three know about the truth, they didn't hesitate to finish off this Gojyo, yet another way to ward off their anger at the kappa.\r\n\r\nThe real Gojyo meanwhile was having a tough time with Kami-sama, who had wanted to keep Gojyo as his new toy.",

Kami-sama then claims that he is the rightful successor to the title Sanzo from his master. Sanzo disagrees with him. \"You may have succeeded the power, the robe and the city, but you NEVER succeeded the title of Sanzo.\" This made Kami-sama rather angry as he sent his armies of toys at Sanzo-ikkhou.",

Surprisingly enough, instead of opening a qi barrier, Hakkai just stopped his qi bolt attack and blocked the bullets with his own body. Stunned by Hakkai's action, Kami-sama failed to realise that he was shot with Sanzo's shoureiju. Hakkai was actually blocking the rosary beads from hitting Sanzo, not opening the qi barrier to allow Sanzo's bullets to pass.\r\n\r\nAs Kami-sama lay defeated on the ground, the castle begins to crumble. \"It's a game my *sensei played.

Gee, could there maybe be something...strange...about this place?\r\n\r\nWe get a nice look at Gojyo in the shower (rear view =), humming contentedly to himself, until the water quits running. He steps out drying his hair and griping to Hakkai. Hakkai says they can't really complain, as the room was so cheap. Room service knocks on the door and Goku charges to retrieve their food; there's no one there, and all that's on the serving cart is a tray with four pint cartons of milk and packaged sandwiches. Goku can't believe this is supposed to be dinner, but the hungry foursome eats it anyway. The shower's broken, grumbles Gojyo, and there's no TV or radio [huh? they never have TV or radio...even Hakuryu only had a radio in the OVA...], and to top it off, Sanzo's out of cigarettes. Are they really gonna stay in this dump? Hakkai diplomatically says they may as well just bear with it tonight and get an early start in the morning.\r\n\r\nGoku goes to check out the bleak lobby, hoping for a newsstand that might have cigarettes (and, with luck, snacks) but nope. Figured as much, he sighs. The innkeeper apologizes, and asks if he might be interested in this: a boxed board game. It's a lot of fun, he says, it might help with your boredom. Goku agrees the time might pass more quickly if they played, and the man gives him the game and box of playing pieces, saying there's no other game like this in the world.\r\n\r\nGoku brings the game to their room, where Hakkai asks if it's Parcheesi (as Goku did when he first saw it) and examines one of the playing pieces, which are all human figures roughly resembling Lego people. He comments that it looks odd, and it breaks into a big grin; Hak",

The guys get downright catty, even Goku, who suggests that he's not nearly as popular with the ladies as he thinks (Hakkai: \"Now, now, Goku, let's not tell him the truth.\").

Though it did seem that they all heard the gunfire...)==UH-oh; there's the Maten Sutra caught on a tree branch, lost in Sanzo's fall!\r\nSanzo reaches the bottom a second before Lirin and instantly aims at her; she grins wryly and says she's failed.

It's the inn's job to clean up, said Gojyo, but Hakkai persisted that the ikkou goes far overboard,and last time they almost lost Sanzo's sutra in a mountain of trash--what if it got thrown away?\r\nOK, OK, we'll clean it up, grumbled the kappa; you just get some sleep.

Not too manly, huh? the scarred one taunts her. Fumika says they're unforgivable, but still doesn't pull the damn trigger because she has to make her speech.

Goku tells Kou it's impossible to stop Gato by just wounding him, as Hazel will keep healing him with youkai souls, but Kou grates that that doesn't matter: \"I'll vaporize him.\" Seriously pissed-off-mad (and he's gorgeous that way =), the prince tells Goku that the ikkou is in his way and needs to clear the hell out now. Goku grins and says he gets it; grateful Yaone gives him the thanks the prince is too angry to give, Goku replies with a thumbs-up and bounds back to his crew.

Hazel chuckles, commenting that children do favor their mothers; and then quietly adds that he's an orphan, and never knew his parents. I have no memories of bein' cared for that way, he says. There's a shade of sympathy in Sanzo's eyes, as you can imagine. We see him remembering a day in the past: Kouryuu standing in the rain with a begging-bowl, rain dripping off his hat, softly chanting as he waited for passers-by to give coin offerings for the temple. He watched a small boy ride past on his dad's shoulders, and then the sun broke through the rainclouds, and Koumyou arrived, calling for him.==\r\n\r\nHe's pulled from his reverie by the smash of a plate on the floor and a woman's scream--the restaurant is being attacked by youkai, and they've spotted Sanzo.

Gojyo says Hakkai (who's yet again feeding a tidbit to Hakuryu on his shoulder) will regret it if he makes a habit of always feeding Goku when he complains; the saru is outraged...but Sanzo, smoking, is lost in thought.

Hazel replies that it's fine if he wants to see it that way, but no matter how long he waits, those youkai won't be coming to his rescue.
