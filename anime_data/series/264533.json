Amidst this culture clash, the school now faces closure due to the enrollment of fewer and fewer students.\r\n\r\nWith the school planning to close within three years, nine female students come together with one thing in mind—form a pop idol group to revive the school's popularity and keep it from shutting down. \"In order to protect our beloved school, there's only one thing we can do... become pop stars!\"\r\n\r\nTheir goal is simple: Become an overnight sensation and use their nationwide media exposure to promote their school and bring in a wave of new students to the ailing area. A simple but solid plan, they figure. Naturally, they're nervous and wonder if this plan can really succeed, but for better or worse their new journey has begun...",
