    "SummaryEnglish": "Although movies combining animation and camera-shot scenes have been created from time to time in Hollywood, ranging from the old \"Anchors Aweigh\" and \"Song of the South\" to the recent \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" and \"Space Jam,\" this style was rarely attempted on Japanese television. It was extremely difficult to produce a series of 30-minute programs with the level of technology available in Japan at that time. This work is impressive for its social themes, revolving around a conflict between a minority vampire tribe whose members transform into wolves, including the main boy character Toppei, and the human beings who try to oppress them. The appearance of Tezuka Osamu playing himself was also of great interest at the time.",
