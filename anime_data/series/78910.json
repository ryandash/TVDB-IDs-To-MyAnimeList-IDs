Dan, Guenevere, Sue, and Michael are sent down to Antarctica to intercept an alien invader. While searching for the alien and fighting it, Sue ends up causing an avalanche that traps both her SARG and the alien at the bottom of a giant crevasse. The episode is pretty dull, it spends the entire time with Sue trying to get her SARG up the side of the crevasse (because her thrusters are damaged) and inter-cuts the action with flashbacks to her upbringing. It’s quite gratuitous and really doesn’t give any insights into Sue at all.",

He claims that his last memory was of seeing the anomaly up-close before returning to Earth in the form of the alien invaders. The flashback includes some other interesting developments – the long-haired man who turned Ryu into a spy was Yuri’s mission commander on Earth named Colonel David Lawrence who also was a close friend of Yuri (and was coincidentally against using Yuri’s mission to investigate the anomaly).",

With the capture of the FUNERAL personnel, the high end staff members are being transported to another base for interrogation; but the group discusses the known facts and are able to trace the extent of influence that this new group has had, running back to their interference with the original creation of Frank at the research facility. Thankfully, David Lawrence shows up in a SARG unit to force down the transport, but his news isn’t good. David tells the FUNERAL staff that another invader is approaching Earth… one that’s over 8,000 km long and possesses enough mass and magnetic forces to destroy the planet.",

The plan is as basic as it gets: the cruiser will fly low under radar and fake an emergency allowing them access to the base’s airspace. Once in the airspace, Guenevere will deploy in their one SARG to occupy the defenses while Ryu and Hattie enter the base to free Frank… Yuri… the eX-1… Mr. Elf… the big guy!",

To even the odds, Sue takes control of one of the damaged ZODs and joins the fray. Guenevere spends the entire fight closing on the alien while trying to save the captured pilot on-board the alien. Her SARG manages to free the pilot before failing due to sustained damage. At this point the alien unleashes its’ primary attack, a supernova with itself at the center. Unable to move, Guenevere and the saved pilot are now directly in harm’s way.",
