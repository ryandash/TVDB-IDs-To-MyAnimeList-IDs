    "SummaryEnglish": "The story takes place in the heart of the Ashram boarding school and follows the apprenticeship of five young women nicknamed the \"Pentagrams\", who seek to become \"true ladies worthy of the name\". In a very friendly atmosphere, they study the art of magic and etiquette on a daily basis, and develop their general culture. Arsnotoria, Mell, Little Alberta, Picatrix and Abramelin, the five students in question, follow classes together, participate in common activities and even have tea after class, in a mysterious room... In such an establishment, no day is like to another and the fun is bound to be there!",
