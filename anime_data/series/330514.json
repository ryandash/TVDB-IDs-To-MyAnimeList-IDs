Onii-san television series premiered. \r\nWhile this episode is more or less a recap episode of the latter half of the Kimagure Orange Road TV series, it does promote and showcase the Moeru! Onii-san TV series which was set to take over its timeslot. \r\nWhile not a cross-over, it is interesting to listen to Kazuki Yao perform his upcoming voice acting role as Kenichi Kokuhou while interacting with Tooru Furuya, Eriko Hara and Hiromi Tsuru as they perform their respective voice acting roles as Kyousuke Kasuga, Hikaru Hiyama and Madoka Ayukawa.",
