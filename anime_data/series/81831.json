It turns out it's a package for Lala, so Mikado tells Lala to check it out. Lala, Rito, and Saruyama go to the school roof to check out the package, and as Lala opens it, a giant wolf jumps out and attempts to kill Lala. The wolf then suffers stomach pains and explains that she's pregnant, and that she accepted a mission to kill Lala before she knew her pregnancy would become a problem. Rito, Saruyama, and Lala are apalled to hear this, and so they take the wolf mother to the school infirmary. Saruyama is then left in charge of taking care of her while she's giving birth. Lala believes the wolf mother deserves a souvenir as a gift for her child's birth. The wolf mother then tells Lala that she wants Saruyama as her gift. After hearing this, Saruyama angrily declines. Lala tells Risa and Mio about Saruyama becoming a gift for the wolf, and so they decide to dress him up as a fish so he'll look like a more memorable souvenir. They take Saruyama to the wolf to show her that he's ready to be taken with her. The wolf then asks if Saruyama is going out with another girl, because if he is, she believes his happiness is important and doesn't wish to interfere with his relationship. Lala says he isn't, but Saruyama quickly declines and takes advantage of this moment to find a girl quickly as an excuse to not be taken as a souvenir. All the girls in the school reject him however, except for Haruna who tries to help him. As Saruyama asks Haruna to go out with him, Rito becomes jealous and stops Saruyama from using Haruna. Now incredibly deperate for an excuse, Saruyama finds a dog outside which he uses as his excuse. As he goes back to the infirmary to show the wolf mother his newly acquired girlfriend, Lala tells them that she left with her baby because she wants Saruyama to be happy. Saruyama cries from hearing this, and then discovers the dog he found was actually a male.",

Rito tells her that Lala is back at home building something, in which after hearing this, Yami-chan leaves. When Rito returns, he finds that Lala constructed a large drill machine which she intends to use to dig underground and hopefully find a hot spring. Mio, Risa, Mikado-sensei, Yami-chan, Haruna-chan, and Saruyama are all invited to join Rito and Lala dig underground. As they travel, they find Tokugawa's hidden treasure and the entrance to Atlantis, which Lala blatantly passes by due to there being no presence of a hot spring nearby. They eventually come across what is called the Seven Colored Hot Springs due to the water appearing as seven different colors. All the girls enjoy using the big and spacious springs, while Saruyama and Rito are stuck using a very small and cramped one. Saruyama decides to get out of the small spring and mess with the girls in the other hot springs. Rito soon follows, and sees Saruyama chasing after Risa and Mio, which Rito then tells him to stop. They come across Mikado-sensei and Yami-chan, who then punches them both with her hair stating that she hates ecchi people. Lala then tells Haruna she needs to leave the spring to try and find a hot spring she can bring back to Rito's house. Rito then finds Haruna and they try to start a conversation with each other, which is then interrupted by Lala who tells them that they need to leave quickly because she accidentally hit an underground volcano.

After Lala calls upon Zastin and her other bodyguards to help rebuild the dilapidated building, the Yuuki Pavilion opens and begins accepting customers. While the number of customers increases, Rito finds himself overrun and is quickly becoming exhausted; as a result he begins to recruit help from Oshizu, the ghost inhabiting the building, Yami-chan, who works as a maid in order to stay for free, and his sister Mikan who will be the chef for the inn. As the number of customers eventually dwindles to zero, a large group of miniature samurai-like men, from the planet Ako, begin to arrive. During repeated attempts to solidify an attack plan on the planet Deviluke, they are repeatedly interrupted by Rito's attempts to offer them food and a bath. Eventually the leader accepts an offer of tea while he is in the midst of using a hologram to show the systems outlying Deviluke. When one of his men tries to hide the hologram, he responds by saying, \"Don't mind it. The primitive people of Earth won't understand what it is.\" Lala, however, immediately recognizes the planet on display which leads to a confrontation between the samurai and Rito, Lala, Yumi-chan, Zastin and the bodyguards. In the end, the inn is destroyed and with it Rito's dreams of being the universe's best alien hotel are lost.",

Nana also comments about making a new friend to Lala. During the dinner service, Rito freaks out over Yami's Taiyaki soup and thinks she may have set a trap. He nearly vomits and asks to go shopping.\r\n\r\nDuring bedtime, Rito finds Momo in his bed. Momo warned Rito earlier that she must protect Rito to allow the harem plan to progress. Yami may kill Rito in his sleep. As Rito tries to sleep, Momo caresses him every way, forcing Rito to shove her aside. As Rito later takes a drink, Yami asks Rito for a talk. Yami explains about her cooking lessons and compares it to her attacks. Momo mistakens it for an assault and jumps down to defend Rito. Yami only wanted to know if Rito enjoyed her Taiyaki soup.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Yami also becomes enrolled. Mea finds with Yami and explains how she is Yami's sister with similar abilities. During class, Yami does not get along with other students and blocks people from befriending her. Momo offers to help but get rejected too. Meanwhile, Mea asks Nana about Rito. Nana simply replies, \"He's a beast.\" Her rambling comments about Rito only interests Mea, who then goes to find Rito herself. Momo then talks to Mikado-sensei, who loved Yami being enrolled. She tells Momo how Yami's lifestyle has been nothing except fighting. While Yami is sitting on a bench wondering about her feelings Yui approaches Yami and tells her that not understanding their own feelings is normal, and she too does not understand her own feelings.

Later in Mikado-sensei's office, Rito and friends discuss about Lala's inventions and Oshizu asks about Lala's childhood.

The apartment is empty and Mea notes that she lives alone. Nana finds it strange knowing that Yami is her sister while Momo was hoping to collect more details about master. In the follow-up meeting with Mikado-sensei and Oshizu, Momo expresses concerns about Mea and how she may be hiding her true heart. Yami notes that their hearts are incomparable with a human's heart because she and Mea are both weapons. Rito invalidates Yami's claim and relates the sibling analogy to Mikan. The meeting is cut short when a dog clings onto Oshizu, making her rip Yami's clothes, causing Yami to chase after Rito.\r\nAfterschool, Ren gives Rito Run's CD and explains about Lala's pure sweet child personality.
