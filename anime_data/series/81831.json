The wolf then asks if Saruyama is going out with another girl, because if he is, she believes his happiness is important and doesn't wish to interfere with his relationship.

Mikan is concerned about leaving Momo with Rito but endures it. On the way home, Momo hopes to seduce Rito with her visual novels but is stopped by Nemesis who is looking for entertainment by making Rito her servant. Rito agrees hoping to learn more about Nemesis and much to Momo's disappointment. Nemesis challenges Rito to many games and has him feed her, making Momo jealous. Nemesis soon understands the environment around Yami and Mea and compares herself to both of them. Rito tries to ask Nemesis more about Darkness, but Nemesis gives a vague response that Darkness will bring chaos, angering Momo. Later, Mikan rushes home fearing Momo; instead, she finds everyone enjoying dinner cooked by Momo. Momo then tries to sneak into Rito's bath but finds Nemesis already inside. Nemesis used her transform ability to seduce Rito and wants to take Rito from Momo. Momo tries to fight back but Nemesis uses her trump card by calling Mikan with Rito's voice. Mikan arrives and finds Momo with an unconscious Rito, resulting in a big scolding for Momo. The next day, Mikan, preventing Momo from bathing with Rito, sneaks into Rito's bath first. Rito is suspicious of Mikan and questions her. Mikan replies that the situation is normal because they're siblings. As they share the bathtub, Mikan asks Rito about his progress with other girls. Rito gives a lackluster reply. Mikan then mentions the harem making Rito panic and rise. He accidentally exposes his private parts to Mikan and escapes from the bath, bumping into Momo who is eavesdropping. Rito suspects that it was Momo's plan to get Mikan to take a bath with him.",
