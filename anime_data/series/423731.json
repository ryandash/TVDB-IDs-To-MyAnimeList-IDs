The answer he receives surprises but also reassures him. Meanwhile, shooting for the TV drama Shuten continues as Toi and Takaaki work through their last scene together.",

In their conversation, Ejima says that he still adores Shou's violin playing, but he also has doubts about Shou performing as an idol. Haruto is afraid that Ejima doesn't understand Shou's commitment to music. Ejima explains his own passion for music and his deep respect for Shou's violin playing. Haruto, disappointed that he never felt passion like that in his life, hangs on Ejima's every word.",

However, on the advice of show planner Taiga Orihara—an old rival of Issa's from his rock band years—the roles are reversed. While Issa's genius-level acting skills allow him to slip into his role with ease, Futaba struggles to take on the persona of an 'older brother.' Fellow Tsukino Productions members Haru Yayoi, Shiki Takamura, and Gaku Oguro then show up to form a new group called The Oniichans and teach Futaba what it's like to be a big brother.",
