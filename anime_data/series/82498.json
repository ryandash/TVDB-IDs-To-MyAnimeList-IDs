After the dream, she wanders into the night and is captured by a group of ronin led by the brother of the priest Manji had killed. Manji pursues Machi but is unable to prevent her from being killed. In response, he kills every member of the ronin group, and upon returning to Yaobikuni, declares that he will seek redemption for the 100 men he killed by killing 1000 evil men.",
