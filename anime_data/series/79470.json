Meanwhile, Maximilien approaches a now hateful Robin, commenting that Robin's ability to actually carry the Psalms is a sign that the Psalms want change to occur in France, and telling him to take revenge for his murdered friends. D'Eon is chased down by palace guards, but Lorenza kills them, and once free he visits Anna's coffin. He then sneaks into Broglie's room and forces him to bring him to the King's chambers. Lia then takes over, asking the King whether he was responsible for the deaths of Anna, Queen Marie, and Lia herself.",
