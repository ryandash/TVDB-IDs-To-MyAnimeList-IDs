Saitama cuts off the narration in his impatience and Armored Gorilla then explains that Doctor Genus wants Saitama for his experiments. Genos and Saitama decide to attack immediately, since the store discount day is the next day. Before they leave, Genos asks Armored Gorilla about any cyborgs active four years ago that have destroyed any towns, which Armored Gorilla denies. In preparation for Saitama's arrival, the House of Evolution sets traps in their facility and reluctantly decide to release Asura Rhino. Once they arrive, Genos destroys the above-ground facility with a single blast before heading underground. The released Asura Rhino fights with Genos, taking no damage in the process. Asura Rhino then faces off against Saitama, but backs off when he detects how powerful Saitama really is. Saitama then reveals to the room his somewhat mundane daily training regime of 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats and 10 km of running, much to Genos's disbelief. Asura Rhino unleashes his Asura Mode and appears to be beating Saitama back, but it transpires that Saitama was just shocked by the realization that the store discount day was that day instead of the next and defeats Asura Rhino easily, leaving soon after with Genos to catch the rest of the discount day. Having witnessed this, Doctor Genus abandons his plans of artificial evolution. After the credits, officials from the Heroes Association inspect the House of Evolution blast site and discuss Genos's destructive power.",
