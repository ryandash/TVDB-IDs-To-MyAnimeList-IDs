Unfortunately for both, the Demon Realm isn't what it used to be by a long stretch. One of the reasons Glenda wants to take over in this world is that her father is set on a remodeling project of the entire world that'll make it more tourist friendly. So things like the evil looking range of mountains have blue bows and candies across it. The sky has pastel flowers littered through it. It's just far too cute. And even getting to meet the lord of the demon world is amusing since he's thrown his back out while doing all the redecorating.",
