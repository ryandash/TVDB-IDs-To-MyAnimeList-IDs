He gets them to turn the radio and TV off and discovers that Bungle forgot to pass on a message that was left for him. Later, George and Bungle make party invitations and George asks Bungle to pass all the crayons. But Bungle mishears and thinks he asked him to parcel up all the crayons. Zippy is sad when Bungle tells him he's not invited to the party. But then Bungle says he was only joking which cheers Zippy up again. Rod, Jane and Freddy sing \"If You Ever Want To Play A Game\". Bungle does a mime, pretending to be a policeman directing traffic. Geoffrey reads a story called \"Charlie's News\". Bungle, Zippy and George have a treasure hunt in the garden.",
