Trapped until they can reunite and perform the charm correctly, the students will have to solve the mystery of the haunted school in order to make it out alive. Before that ill-fated event, however, the friends led ordinary lives. Corpse Party: Missing Footage reveals an insight into the students' lives on the day before they were thrust into a waking nightmare.",

Satoshi gives his slip to Naomi, who had lost hers, and intends to use Yuka's slip for himself, unaware that it is actually Yuuya's. Naomi and Ayumi both successfully return to Kisaragi Academy, but because Satoshi used a slip belonging to someone from a different school, only his detached arms come with them. A post-credits scene shows Naomi catatonic in her room, her mother disbelieving the existence of her dead classmates.",
