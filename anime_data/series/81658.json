Of course, there's also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines.",

Determined to drive a faster car, he follows his mechanic friend Ko-chan to a junkyard upon hearing a newer 300ZX model is available. While at the junkyard, he sees the scrapped body of a midnight blue Nissan S30, equipped with a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 L and fitted with twin turbos. Attracted to it, he attempts to buy it but the junkyard owner, Kuro, refuses as Kuro was told by the previous owner to scrap the car because it is cursed. After telling Ko-chan that he remembers seeing this car a few years ago, they eventually agree to buy the car. Akio sells off his 300ZX to fund the purchase, much to Ma's exasperation.",
