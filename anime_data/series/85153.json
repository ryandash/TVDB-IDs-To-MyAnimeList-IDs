    "SummaryEnglish": "In what seems ordinary belies occurances of unexplainable circumstances, and underlying these special occurances is the presence of one's dreams or \"yume\". In this world, the said \"yume\" is composed of strong emotions... Simultaneously, these emotions will break free from one's mind and transcend the borders to reality. Once the fine line between dream and reality is crossed, these \"yume\" may turn into nightmares and invite disasters. Misako Mishima and Touko Mishima are amateur dream-users or \"yume tsukai(s)\". They possess special powers to exterminate and control these nightmares. They will then search for the source of the \"yume\" and return it to the rightful owner.",

After a labyrinthine journey to the Warabe Yuusai Toy Store, the Nichiyousei Yume Tsukai Touko Mishima explains Yuuka the situation in more detail with a brief demonstration before Rinko returns with a dream fragment; even after several in-flight paper airplanes, it is still not exactly clear what the deviant diagnostic is. A visit from the girls' aunt Misako ultimately becomes the skeleton key for Touko to learn Yuuka's prologue with Kei along with the insight of what now needs to take place; a fierce battle laden with Shinto ritualistic mechanics later, Yuuka is left with a dangerous opportunity with how she handles her feelings for Kei.",

It is not long before the two Yume Tsukai encounter the proactive proximity precautions of Haru's nightmare which proves beyond the available combat capabilities; while Rinko divides her frustration between not getting to Haru and being forced to fight the nightmare alone, Touko has devised a counter-strategy to avail at the next engagement that utilizes an iconoclastic but crucial resource -- the Kinyousei Yume Tsukai Hajime Tachibana who proves himself the skeleton key for successfully approaching Haru for insight as to the situation. While poor Rinko is stuck as a diversion, Hajime quickly makes friends with Haru as he gets right to the heart . . . or in this case, graphite of the matter. Touko now recovered from her cold and galvanized with the data of Haru's collaborative prologue with her parents, it now becomes clear what ultimately has to be done; the nightmare now conquered, Haru realizes the true meaning behind her father's injunction against troubling Setsuko who realizes that it is not her choice whether Haru sees her father.",

While the chagrined Rinko rails and wails at Touko in frustration, Yuuko Aomori is prosecuting a typical workday when a nightmare spawned by her infatuation with her supervisor Kouji Nagasaki begins to visibly follow her around; galvanized by the circumstances thereof while eating lunch, Touko explains Yuuko her perspective on the deviant diagnostic prior to Rinko easily subduing the nightmare. What the two Yume Tsukai do not realize is that the situation is far more complex than initially meets the eye when the nightmare's fusion with Yuuko ultimately drives home the lesson of why »indecision« is spelled as it is when the nightmare begins wreaking havoc in the office; an emphatic and effulgent demonstration of the Dream Cyclone later, Yuuko goes from lusting after Kouji to herself being lusted after by Kageki Shimane who ironically finds himself the vassal of that same nightmare.",

While Rinko desperately tries to stave off air sickness and wrap her mind around the circumstances, the Doyousei Yume Tsukai Satoka Sagawa is bootstrapping herself for a rendezvous with Touko at the Nagasaki Airport. Grimacing at being forced to show Satoka the ropes of being a Yume Tsukai while Touko takes a catnap, Rinko is frustrated at how clumsily and unprofessionally Satoka does her job when Masashi Nakaoka angrily repulses their incursion; later that evening after extinguishing the subsequent adversarial divergent concourse, Touko explains Rinko her perspective on how things are far more circuitous than meets the eye considering that Satoka is still mourning her fallen boyfriend Satoru Jissouji. Masashi's decision to pre-emptively lash out unto the town the next morning ultimately brings things to a head; in spite of Satoka being of much greater utility in the ensuing melee, neither Rinko nor Touko has a healthy perspective of what responsible dreaming is.",

The scant background data of the incident quickly becomes irrelevant when Rinko finds Mayumi home alone in spite of being even younger than Rinko herself and again when Mayumi changes the subject when Rinko inquires about the Daruma doll; unnerved at the prospect of Rinko learning the truth and eventually neutralizing it, the nightmare inquires Rinko her motivations before sending her on her way. Things ultimately come to a head when Touko and Hajime confirm what Rinko is already seeing for herself -- the grandmother Yoriko and her granddaughter's nuclear family frustrated that they cannot understand each other; the nightmare being neutralized with a effulgent discharge of the Dream Cyclone becomes the preamble of both Rinko and Yoriko walking away with a novel and healthy perspective of their respective families",

While Touko takes the exhibitionist color scheme on Satoka's jet and Satoka's excitement in stride, a none-too-amused Rinko takes it upon herself to explain Satoka the historical origins of the Yume Tsukai along with their armaments whose dormant forms are as children's toys and asks that her seniority be acknowledged instead of being behaved toward as a child. Hajime arrives in time to introduce himself as Rinko is leading Satoka to the main house oblivious to Satoka's true reason for being in Tokyo -- a clue of which Touko picks up when Satoka races off after Hajime unwisely demonstrates the mechanics of the Dream Cyclone. Meanwhile, Satoka is about to collapse into despair when Rinko's arrival galvanized by Hajime's insight as to the depicted location becomes the preamble for an exciting adventure through the city demonstrating that Rinko can be just as mischievous as any normal-powered little kid her age when she leads Satoka through a construction site under the nose of its burly foreman that ironically becomes the deus ex machina for the girls to reach their destination. Rinko is quite incensed to ultimately find that Satoka's motive for the mad dash through town is to buy snacks from a store whose dusk consumption is to commemorate a promise made before Satoru's death but acknowledges that a strong bond was formed between the two.",

Even during the school day, it becomes apparent that Mizuki realizes that he is sailing into very choppy ethical waters that become tempestuous when Mizuho is accosted by a plant monster as she is completing her home commute; in spite of Rinko successfully incinerating the monster, it is but a symptom of a much greater problem in the background as Touko collects Mizuki's band-aid and inquires Mizuho her prologue with Mizuki. Galvanized with the full background data, Touko declares zero hour for rescuing Mizuki only to find that he is punishing himself for his perspective of Mizuho as his paramour in spite of her being his biological sister. Mizuho's fervent pleas against being left behind ultimately become the ironic deus ex machina that causes the nightmare to become frightened for its survival; a fierce battle culminating to a last-minute collaborative fatal assault later, Mizuki arrives at a pragmatic homeostasis with Mizuho to restore the brother-sister relationship.",

Meanwhile Touko and Rinko are using their home commute to exchange perspectives of their previous job when they come across a boy named Kentaro using a rather dubious method to discern Wakaba's status; after a »Whoa, hold your horses!!!« intercession and some teasing from Rinko, what Kentaro and the two Yume Tsukai find is no laughing matter -- Wakaba enveloped inside an egg that is reversing the effects of Wakaba's actions during her lifetime. Desperate for Wakaba's survival, Kentaro races off to find Wakaba's parents with Rinko right on his heels in a bid to intercept the nightmare and prevent its rampage through time all the way to Wakaba's first day of grade school only to be one step behind the whole time. Rinko's observation that Kentaro himself has some memories of Wakaba along with Touko having figured out the mechanics of the whole situation which has come to a head becomes the ultimate skeleton key by which the nightmare is neutralized; as an ancillary bonus, Wakaba successfully attains her first kiss while her family government works things out in a rational and mature fashion.",

The investigation gets a big shot in the arm with the insight of Keigo and his girlfriend Yumi; while Touko tries to innovate a deus ex machina to neutralize the nightmare, things continue to deteriorate as the prospect of a flawless citywide fatality ratio becomes evident. Touko is shocked at the ironic epilogue of Keigo ultimately proving himself a cold psychopath that decides upon being eaten by one of his energy dragons as a consolation prize; while the city's survival has been secured, Touko can no longer ignore the traumatic guilt of seeing her father's death at the hands of a nightmare.",

The section chief explains Misako the three week old situation of Kanno indulging in his fantasy of a buxom-breasted woman at his beck and call along with their being five missing female employees; in spite of comprehending the situation as a Yume Tsukai, it does not prepare Misako for Kanno to callously abandon the nightmare Pai-Pai or for beginning to sympathize with the nightmare that has now taken to pampering her.
