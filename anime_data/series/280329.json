Meanwhile, Tatsumi fights Kaku, another member of Team Stylish, and is shocked to find that he has possession of Ecstasy, Sheele's old Imperial Arm. The battle is interrupted by Mine, who is also horrified to see Ecstasy, and she quickly kills Kaku, safely retrieving Ecstasy. Trooma prepares to ambush Mine, but is attacked by Leone, who had recovered, and she accidentally kills him with a single blow, to her displeasure. After Night Raid regroups, everyone but Tatsumi suddenly collapses, having been afflicted with a paralytic poison during the battle. When more foot soldiers move in, a biological Imperial Arm named Susanoo intervenes and dispatches them. Outmatched, Dr. Stylish injects himself with a liquid that turns him into a Danger Beast, and he consumes his remaining men. Tatsumi, Akame, and Susanoo fight Dr. Stylish before he is shot by Mine, allowing Akame to slash Dr. Stylish's real body contained in the Danger Beast, killing him.

Angered, Mine decides to teach Chelsea a lesson and recruits Lubbock and Tatsumi, the latter of whom uses Incursio to sneak on the hot spring where Chelsea is bathing. However, Tatsumi instead confronts Susanoo, but it is actually Chelsea using her Teigu, Gaea Foundation, which changes her physical appearance. Chelsea tells her story about her former team being massacred, leaving her as the only survivor, and she reveals that she berated Night Raid because she didn't want them to die like her former team did. Meanwhile, a depressed Esdeath learns of the loss of Dr. Stylish and comforts Seryu when she grieves his death. At the Capital, Run tells Esdeath that there are many lookalikes of Tatsumi for her to court, but Esdeath declares that there is only one Tatsumi.

The next day, Wave recalls the incident and notes that the present merchants were terrified of Bols despite his kind personality because of his otherwise fearsome appearance. However, Bols tells him that despite his personality, he had killed many people in the past, which understandably earned him a lot of hate. Then, the group is visited by Bols's wife and young daughter who support his work, which surprises Wave. Meanwhile, while doing some training with Susanoo, Tatsumi tells him that he should be considered one of Night Raid, not as a tool. Later, Night Raid travels to another hideout and are given their newest mission: to kill the modified Danger Beasts, essentially helping the Capital they have been fighting. When Chelsea states her belief that the Jaegers should take care of the problem, Tatsumi counters that by aiding the Capital, they would be able to save more lives. Chelsea later confides to Najenda that she believes Tatsumi's kindness will eventually lead him to his death. Esdeath and Run express to each other their beliefs that, since the new Danger Beasts were revealed to have once been human, they were possibly the result of one of Dr. Stylish's experiments, and assume they somehow managed to escape their containment. The following night, while patrolling the mountains, Tatsumi learns about Lubbock's reasons for joining Night Raid, which involved Najenda. Later, Tatsumi travels to the summit of a mountain alone and is suddenly confronted by a wandering Esdeath, who is shocked to see him.",

Later, Najenda tells Night Raid about Path of Peace, a pacifist religious organization that is inciting a religious insurrection, and that the Revolutionary Army (the rebellion force Night Raid is a part of) and an allied tribe will launch attacks against the Capital simultaneous to Path of Peace's uprising. She then assigns Night Raid to assassinate Borick, the adviser to Path of Peace's founder who is a spy for the prime minister and is drugging several of the religion's followers into obedience, also instructing them to take out the Jaegers, especially Kurome and Bols, who will undoubtedly respond. The next day, Akame begins expressing her doubts about battling Kurome, but Mine comforts her. Meanwhile, Esdeath splits the Jaegers into two teams: she will attack Najenda with Seryu and Ran, while Wave, Kurome, and Bols will pursue Akame.
