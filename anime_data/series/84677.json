The Queen also indicates that Leerin’s father’s senior apprentice has died, and she seems to give him back a dite. Back at Gorneo’s room, Haia and Myunfa are introducing themselves to Shante and Gorneo and Gorneo questions their true intentions. Haia actually just actually wants information from Gorneo about the Fallen One. Later, Harley and Layfon are seen replacing Layfon’s broken adamandite sword. Harley says it will be easier for him just to make a new one, and tells Layfon to try out a Katana due to his fighting style. However, Layfon says he can’t use it for reasons we don’t know yet. Nina asks Layfon what’s wrong with him, but then Naruki comes in and asks for Nina’s and Layfon’s help to find out more about the Overload smugglers and users. Layfon tells Felli they won’t be having practices for a while, and thus she leaves and meets Haia, Myunfa, and her brother Kallian at the train station. In the next scene, Layfon, Nina, and Naruki are observing the 10th platoon (Dinn Dee’s platoon) and Naruki tells them that they are the Overload users. After Dinn’s practice with his platoon, he and Siena are seen leaving. Nina confronts Dinn face to face and tells him to stop using the Overload. Dinn says it is impossible due to the fact that he wants to become stronger. Later Nina tells the story of how Sharnid became part of her 17th platoon. Layfon, Nina, and Sharnid all go to Kallian and ask him for information regarding Dinn. Kallian comes up with a plan to disband the 10th platoon, and tells them that Layfon needs to work with Haia to stop Dinn. We are also told that since Layfon was taught the Psyharden Fighting Style, he could easily accomplish the task if he used a Katana instead of his adamandite sword.

In his reminiscence, he remembers how their city lost the intercity match, making their former platoon leader become dejected. After seeing their former platoon leader in such a state, Sharnid, Sheena, and Dinn, all made a vow to defend Zuelli with their own hands. However, Sharnid also informs the 17th platoon that at the time of the vow their friendship was already breaking up, and he left the 10th platoon to try to completely break the three of them up. Thus he wants this chance to completely break them up and then try to reconnect them together again. Moments later the inter-platoon match has started, and Dinn is doing amazingly well as he has already broken through many of the traps set by the 17th platoon, but is feeling side effects from the Overload. Suddenly, the ground in front of the 10th platoon breaks, leaving Siena by herself. Dinn tells her to go on, and she does, meeting Sharnid in a 1v1 fight. Sharnid now shows his new weapons, which are two pistol dites. Siena and Sharnid begin to battle it out, and although Sharnid puts up a good fight, he loses at the end. Thus he begins to interrogate Siena about why Dinn is not letting her help defend Zuelli by using the Overload just as Dinn has been. Layfon has begun to fight with Dinn, and even though Dinn is using Overload, Layfon wins easily. Dinn goes into what seems to be berserker state due to the Fallen One. Haia and his people then appear and have Dinn captured, so that he can get the Fallen One. Layfon, in order to stop Haia, asks Haia to a duel the Psyharden way. While Layfon is dueling Haia, Sharnid and Siena are going to Dinn’s location to try and get the Fallen One out of his body. They get caught up with Myunfa in a tiny skirmish, but win. Finally Siena talks to Dinn about the past, telling him she loved him, and that Dinn has done enough already.",

She declines the option to follow and instead goes out to find Zuellni (the electronic fairy) and see what was wrong with her. Nina goes down into the machinery area and enters an already open door that leads into a chamber with Zuellni trapped inside a crystal and Gandoweria's Fallen One above her. She questions the Fallen One and it simply states that she has an incredibly strong will and it wishes to possess her. Despite Nina refusing it, she was possessed and sent somewhere else. Layfon and the Salinvance Guidance Mercenary Gang ride out towards the Contaminoid nest while being followed by the 17th platoon and Siena (as requested by Layfon). Layfon wishes the 17th platoon to watch and record how the Salinvance Guidance Mercenary Gang fights because he wants to fight with his platoon in the future. Layfon's injuries cause him a few troubles, but he still manages to get the job done. Back in the city, Karyan sends a search team to find Nina and is informed that she simply \"disappeared\".
