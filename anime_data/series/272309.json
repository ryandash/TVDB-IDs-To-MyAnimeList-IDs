Can any of them get past Teshima while they're working on their own, or will Teshima's prophecy that the first years will drop out in 3 more laps come to pass due to the nightly rule of no lapping others in the dark?",

Midosuji tells Imaizumi that all the players are here as he claims Sohoku has made a fatal judging error in not saving anyone for Day 2.",

Imaizumi's confidece suffers a further blow when Midosuji has his teammates accelearate. They manage to catch up to Hakone Academy in two minutes time. 5 kilometers from the sprint marker Midosuji challenges Hakone to a sprint race. Izumida accepts the challenge, but Shinkai Hayato stops him and instead decides to challenge Midosuji. Izumida reveals the numbers at Hakone are strategically placed: 1 is the ace, 2 is the ace's assistant, 3 is the ace climber, and 4 is the ace sprinter. Hayato and Midosuji accelerate, with Hayato saying he isn't doing the sprint for pride. Midosuji begins to panic when he realizes that Hayato is leading him without putting in any real effort. Midosuji is forced to go all out to manage to catch Hayato. In a flashback we see how Hayato almost quit cycling after hitting a mother rabbit. Juichi talks with the senior class to help them understand why Hayato wants to quit the team. In the end though Juichi promises that if Hayato comes back this following year, he will wear tag #4. As we return to the race, Midosuji cries in despair as Hayato continues to get further and further away.",

This news feels Sohoku with hope, and Kinjou takes the lead to prevent anyone else from passing them while they catchup to Hakone and Kyoto Fushimi. Meanwhile Midosuji reveals he has been playing around with Hayato and catches up easily. Eventually Midosuji passes Hayato and says he will only let him pass on the left. We learn that Hayato has been afraid to pass on the left ever since he killed the rabbit, but thanks to special training with his teammates, he has overcome that obstacle by gaining the ability to transform into the Demon of Hakone. Hayato passes Midosuji and is pulling away with only 500 meters to go to the Sprint check. Seeing no other choice, Midosuji removes some tape on his legs that has been constraining his speed. Midosuji manages to get side-by-side with less than 200 meters remaining. Now it is anyone's sprint to win.",

As they pass Kumamoto Daichi, Tadokoro reveals he has fully recovered thanks to Onoda drafting for him. Realizing he can't go any faster, Tadokoro propses to Onoda that they sing even though they don't need to pass anyone. After the two sing the opening song in unison, Onoda proposes they sing the closing song next. Tadokoro remembers when Coach Pierre taught them all that bicycles are actually meant for fun, and he realizes it isn't the song that gives Onoda his strength. Instead it is the joy of cycling. Finally in the final 30 kilometers they catch up with their teammates. With their arrival, the atmosphere completely changes for Sohoku. Kinjou gives one final order. Makishima and Onoda are to lead the team up Mount Fuji so they can compete for the days title. Further up the mountain Hakone appears to be falling apart, and Midosuji can't contain his laughter.

Fukutomi admits he thought Sohoku would fall apart and yet they managed to catch up, but he says they can never prevail without a true ace. Imaizumi declares that he is the new ace and he will take first. Onoda is shocked and asks Makishima if it's ok. Makishima says it is fine because he and Toudou would never let the other finish in first as the ace. Imaizumi then decides to get reckless and move ahead on his own. Makishima keeps Toudou at bay and forces Fukutomi to pursue him. Everytime Fukutomi catches up Imaizumi puts on another burst of speed. We see how Imaizumi became addicted to road racing and how he first met the Kanzaki's. Finally we see Imaizumi thinking to himself and knowing he can win if nothing else changes. However a medical van is further back on the road. It picks up Naruko and has him withdraw from the race. They then clear the road because more racers are coming. Ishigaki collapses and then tells Midosuji to press on at full strength and he will win. An ominious wind then begins to blow as Midosuji begins to ascend the final 15km on his own.",

Instead he decides to race him one-on-one through the mountainous climb. Midosuji quickly realizes the two are apparently even and proposes a wager on their race. The proposal that both agree to is that the loser of their individual race cannot cross the finish line before the winner. Eventually Makashima realizes that Imazumi will be at a major disadvantage if he doesn't have help against the other climbers, and seeing as Onoda has kept up with him he sends him on ahead to try and even the odds.",

Up ahead the aces sense they will soon be caught up to. Fukutomi believes that two racers are coming- Midosuji and Manami, but Imazumi realizes that a third one is gaining ground quickly in Onoda. Toudou asks Makashima why he has such faith in Onoda, and Makashima reveals that Onoda has never once failed to obey an order that has been given to him. He thinks back to Onoda's many races- the uphill climb on his mommy bike, the first year race, the 1000km race against the second years, and even his catch-ups at the Inter-High. With roughly 7km left Onoda catches up to Midosuji and Manami. He vows to not let Midosuji catch up to the aces. Midosuji raises his speed, but Onoda surpasses Midosuji's speed and actually moves ahead of him.",

He catches up again just before Manami and Midosuji catch up to Fukutomi. Onoda, Manami, and Midosuji end in a 3-way tie when they reach Fukutomi, and Onoda admits he didn't realize he was racing. This gives Manami the chills, and he tells Fukutomi that Onoda is the bigest threat there. Meanwhile Imazumi decides to change Onoda's job. He tells him their job is to cross the finish line together to win for Sohoku. Midosuji decides to try and sprint ahead, but Imazumi matches his pace and refuses to let him get ahead. Onoda, Manami, and Fukutomi also maintain the same pace, making it a 5-man race to the finish with only 5km remaining.",
