Timoteo a.k.a. \"Vongola IX,\" the head of the Vongola Family, sent Reborn to train Tsuna; the first Vongola boss moved to Japan, and Tsuna was his great-great-great grandson; the other candidates for the position of the head of the Vongola family died. Enrico, who was the leading candidate to become \"Vongola X\", died in a gun battle. Massimo, the second, \"sleeps with the fishes.\" Federico, the favored son, was found as a pile of bones. For these reasons, Tsuna is the only remaining heir.\r\n\r\nReborn's main instrument of choice in teaching Tsuna is the \"Dying Will Bullet\" (\"Deathperation Shot\" in the English versions), which will make the person be \"reborn\" with a stronger self intent on fulfilling his dying will.",

Vongola Primo converses with Tsuna, revealing the rings had a seal on them, allowing them to be split in half for the Vongola Tournament and their current forms only possess powers equal to the Mare ring. Primo releases the seal causing the Vongola Rings to change forms and disappears. Tsuna continues his battle with Byakuran, overwhelming him completely. As Yuni nearly completes the rite, Gamma manages to infiltrate the barrier and embraces her; exclaiming he will die with her. As the rite completes, their bodies disappear leaving behind the Arcobaleno pacifiers. Tsuna and Byakuran's battle climax with Byakuran perishing from Tsuna's X-Burner.",
