The survivors on the moon founded the Lunar Republic of Eden, a utopian city which guarantees its citizens lives of peace and stability, but at a price: life in Eden is closely monitored and controlled by the powerful regulatory body known as The Guidance Council. Fifteen-year-old Takeru doesn't know the first thing about Eden politics, but has a nagging feeling that things -just ain't right.- He vents his frustrations by racing LTVS -Lunar Terrain Vehicles- with his buddies and generally wasting time.

However, when Takeru is sent on a community service outing to atone for his mischievous behavior, he stumbles upon something that could get him into real trouble, since it may actually be important: a photograph, recent and unaltered, of a girl on Earth.",
