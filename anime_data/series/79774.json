The incident had promptly forced the police to seal off the entire building and cover the entire incident by blaming it on insane patients inside the hospital. In order to take their minds off from the assassination attempt, Ranmaru and Saya went out on for dinner, only to find their boss Kunikida as an uninvited guest.",

Ranmaru was horrified that the pictures in a book found in southern Italy were the same ones that he had encountered a few weeks ago. During a conversation with Saya, she told Ranmaru that Yukino's late mother was murdered supposedly by a vicious thief. Thinking that Yukino may be in danger since her mother's death was at the time when the Machida massacre took place at the same time, he went back to the forensics building to check on Yukino when a Phantom humanoid appeared in the dark and tried to attack Ranmaru, but a spiritual barrier appeared out of nowhere and dazed the human larvae, forcing the humanoid to fight Ranmaru himself. He was eventually wounded by Sakura's broadsword, making the humanoid retreat in defeat with an arm cut off from it.",
