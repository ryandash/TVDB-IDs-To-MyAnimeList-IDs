    "SummaryEnglish": "あずまんが大王, Azumanga Daioh, follows the daily high school lives of six female students and two teachers with unusual personalities, from the first day of high school to graduation. Tomo Takino is the energetic loose cannon; Koyomi \"Yomi\" Mizuhara is the short-tempered, intelligent one; Chiyo Mihama is the 10-year-old genius; Ayumu \"Osaka\" Kasuga is the slow and not too bright one; Sakaki is the shy cat-loving one, prone to cat bites; and Kagura is the resident jock. The teachers include the wacky, childish, English teacher Yukari Tanizaki, and Minamo \"Nyamo\" Kurosawa, the sane gym teacher who gets drunk easily. The anime is based on the original manga by Kiyohiko Azuma, and has five parts to each episode, each with its own title (similar to five mini-episodes put together for one big episode). There are 130 sections in all, neatly fitting into 26 episodes.",
