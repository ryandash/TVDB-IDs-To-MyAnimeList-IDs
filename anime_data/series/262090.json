She urges him to keep any doubts away from the public eye and orders him to capture Makishima. Following Yuki's funeral, Akane agrees to undergo a 'Memory Scoop' to provide a photofit of Makishima based on her memories of the incident, despite warnings from others that it may damage her Psycho-Pass. Despite reliving the traumatizing memory, the Memory Scoop is successfully completed without her Psycho-Pass reaching into dangerous levels, providing a photofit image of Makishima to aid in the investigation. Later, Ginoza discusses with Masaoka, who is actually his father, about how Akane manages to keep her Psycho-Pass from becoming unclouded.",
