    "SummaryEnglish": "This story takes place a little further in the future—There are now billions of card game players in the world, to an extent where card games have become a necessity, a part of our lives.The protagonist of this story, Aichi Sendo, is a timid boy in his third year of middle school. He had been living his life looking backward rather than forward, trying not to stand out. However, he had one thing that kept him going - the Blaster Blade, a card from a card game that was given to him when he was little. That card is the reason why he begins to engage in Cardfights, something that changes his life drastically.\r\n\r\nThe name of the card game is Vanguard. The game takes place in a different planet called Cray. It is a place similar to our own planet, but unlike planet Earth, Gods and Demons, Dragons and other mythical creatures still roam the land. It is also a world where both Magic and Science have advanced hand in hand. Countries with advances in different fields and cultures rule over different parts of the planet Cray. And due to a never before seen play system, it becomes popular throughout the world.\r\n\r\nAichi, immediately attracted by Vanguard, meets friends such as Misaki Togura and Kamui Katsuragi, along with other rivals. Through friendly rivalry with them, Aichi begins to enjoy a fulfilling life. Aichi, however, has a goal: to once again battle with a Vanguard Fighter by the name of Toshiki Kai. Toshiki Kai is an aloof and cold-hearted high schooler who has outstanding abilities in the world of Vanguard. He is also the reason why Aichi started playing the game. For him, Kai is the person who saved him from his boring life and introduced him to Vanguard. In order to get better at Vanguard, Aichi puts his soul into it every day. He wishes that someday, he'll be able to battle Kai and have him recognize his worth.",

Aichi then proceeds to call Gigantech Charger, another new card whose skill is used to completely fill Aichi's side of the field, and finish the match with a Critical Trigger. Team Black Magic's next fighter, Kurosaki, appears, while on Team Q4's side, Kai steps up. They both use Kagero, and the announcer, MC Miya, and spectators seem to think it will be an exciting match. However, they are soon disillusioned - Kai annihilates his opponent without even breaking a sweat. Afterwards, everyone sees that underneath Team Black Magic's dark cloaks are actually three sparkling-bright young men. Kai's victory leads to Team Q4 advancing to the next round and Kamui becoming enraged that he was not given the chance to fight.",

His opponent, Kaoru \"Ka-boom!\" Komatsubara, seems to be a formidable opponent who gloats how he's a national-tournament-level player, but Kai gains an early lead, pushing his enemy into a bad situation. Throughout the battle, Kai chooses to not defend against all except one of Kaoru's attacks, puzzling everyone about his decisions. Aichi believes that Kai is trying to tell him something through these actions; he deduces that Kai knows that he does not need to defend and will still be able to win. When both players are at five damage, Kaoru confidently declares that he will survive and claim victory, but Kai refutes that claim, loudly announcing Final Turn! He rides a new card, Blazing Flare Dragon, and uses a card skill to retire one opposing unit and increase its attack power. Kai relentlessly adds to the power by drawing two Critical Triggers in a row, thoroughly annihilating Kaoru.

Getting his memory back, Kai nonetheless chooses to continue using his current deck, but Aichi is conflicted about using his. Kai tells Aichi that he is bound by his own limits by not wanting to use Gold Paladins and that he needs to break through them.

With Vermillion's Limit Break, Kai attacks all of Aichi's front-row units in one strike and wins as a result.

To use the VF Circuit as a way to reach Takuto, Aichi and Kai go their separate paths.

However, Leon's drive check reveals a stand trigger, giving his vanguard Maelstrom enough power to penetrate Q4's defenses and win the match for Dreadnought.\r\nShortly afterwards, the two teams argue over the value of losing. Leon asks Aichi about what is the path he takes, and Aichi is reminded to make his own path. Leon bids farewell to him and says that they will battle each other again someday. Privately, Jillian asks Leon why he would console his opponents like that, to which he answers by saying it was the \"wind\" that told him to do so. He and Sharlene take an interest in Aichi's gentle \"wind\", which Leon sees as potentially becoming a great \"windstorm\" eventually. After Team Dreadnought is transported away, Shin informs Team Q4 about the next and last stage of the VF Circuit; it will be in their home country, Japan.",

To better prepare the team, Shin recommends for Aichi, Kamui, and Misaki to battle against other stronger, non-Q4-affiliated cardfighters. Aichi takes a look at his Blond Ezel card and is reminded about Kourin, the person who gave it to him. So, Q4 goes to Card Shop PSY and requests for the Ultra Rare girls to cardfight with them for training purposes. They accept, and thus the battles ensue. The first match-up is between Aichi and Kourin, who now uses an Angel Feather deck. Aichi gains the upper hand when he superior rides Pellinore, but Kourin uses her Angel Feathers' skills to swap cards from her damage zone and then calling them. As the fight continues, Kourin antagonistically puts down Aichi by telling him to give up and how he's reached his limits. He proves her wrong and shows his determination when he rides Blond Ezel and activates its Limit Break to defeat her. Despite her harsh words, Kourin is actually glad that Aichi won.\r\nThen, the second match-up starts with Kamui against Suiko, who also uses an Angel Feather deck. Although Kamui takes some precaution by not dealing 4 damage to Suiko for fear of Limit Break, she nonetheless plays a card named Doctroid Micros, whose skill is used to purposely give herself 4 damage. Not only can she now activate the Limit Break of her key card, Chief Nurse, Shamsiel, but she also powers up all of her front-row units as well. How will Kamui deal with Suiko's Limit Break?",

Suiko uses Shamsiel's Limit Break and the Angel Feather stategy of switching cards from her hand with ones from the damage zone, thereby increasing her units' attack strength and acquiring the cards she wants. She also tells Kamui that power alone is not enough to win. Despite her words, Kamui manages to win through the sheer force of Perfect Raizer.\r\nThen, the rematch between Misaki and Rekka begins. Although Misaki gets the first turn, Rekka gets a grade 3 in play first by superior riding her new ace card, Crimson Impact, Metatron. With its Limit Break, Rekka superior calls more Angel Feathers from her damage zone and pressures Misaki to use a lot of her cards to block against her attacks. The two then have a conversation about how it was Rekka who motivated Misaki to change her deck. Misaki further elaborates that she was hesitant on changing her deck because she thought it would also mean changing the memories associated with her first deck. However, Misaki eventually realized that even if she did change her deck, it would not mean losing what was most important to her. Back to the game, Misaki takes a chance by riding another Scarlet Witch, CoCo, sacrificing attack power for the opportunity of drawing the card she needs to win. Her gamble pays off when she draws and calls a second Silent Tom. With 2 Toms, Misaki renders Rekka unable to guard with any grade 0 units against their attacks and emerges victorious. Afterwards, Team Q4 thanks Ultra Rare for the matches. But before Q4 can leave, three mysterious lights shine from the shop's holographic card displays. These lights make their way to Q4 and are revealed to be three new cards, one for each member. Suiko claims that the cards have chosen Q4 to be their owners. With newfound experience and cards, Q4 is now pumped and ready to win the Japan Stage.",

It is really a trap set by Kyou Yahagi and his Team Avengers (all dressed as bugs), who plan to take Dreadnought's spot in the VF Circuit. Although Jillian and Sharlene handily take care of Kyou's teammates, he nonetheless challenges Leon to a cardfight. Now using a Megacolony deck after witnessing the strength of insects from his experience in the jungle, Kyou prevents some of Leon's units from standing and retires others. Thus, he seals the Aqua Force strategy of launching multiple attacks and Blue Storm Dragon, Maelstrom's Limit Break. In spite of Kyou's own Limit Break from his new ace card, Martial Arts Mutant, Master Beetle, Leon overcomes the obstacles against him when he calls more units to replace his rested ones and utilizes the max potential of his Aqua Force clan. Kyou's overconfidence gets the better of him when he leaves himself with little cards to guard against all of Leon's attacks, ultimately leading to his downfall and Leon's victory. After Kyou vows to get revenge on Leon, he and the rest of Team Avengers escape. The scene ends with Kyou and his team aiming to get stronger in outer space (in reality, they are in a public planetarium).",

What's more is that \"special reserve\" cardfighters like Team Unknown (composed of the masked trio of King Z, Queen Y, and Joker X) will participate and act as obstacles for all of the teams. With the rules fully explained, Aichi and Q4 resolve themselves to win the Japan Stage. And so, the fights begin.\r\n\r\nMisaki and Kamui win their respective matches. On the other hand, Aichi is in a close fight in a rematch with Team Jurassic Army's Gunji Ryudo. Against the threatening Limit Break of Ryudo's new ace card, Destruction Dragon, Dark Rex, Aichi successfully defends himself, using a lot of his cards in the process. Despite the odds, Aichi stays determined and utilizes the Limit Break of his Blond Ezel twice, superior calling more units from his deck and gaining power from them, which forces Ryudo to not guard against Ezel's attack. As a result, Aichi is victorious. After saluting him on his win, Ryudo warns Aichi of what's to come in the Japan Stage.\r\nBehind the scenes, Joker X is confronted by Kyou and Team Avengers, who plot to take Team Unknown's masks and assume their roles.

There, he sees the many customers playing Vanguard, which Naoki has no knowledge about. He spots Aichi conversing with Team SIT Genius in the back of the shop. Curious by how different Aichi's behavior is in the card shop compared to how he acts at school because of a card game, Naoki becomes intrigued to Vanguard. And so, Aichi teaches Naoki about Vanguard through playing an actual match, with the latter being lent a new Narukami trial deck to use from Shin. As they cardfight, Naoki slowly gets immersed into the game. After Aichi eventually wins, Naoki buys the trial deck and hastily leaves in a frustrated manner, which worries Aichi. But he is later comforted by Kai who tells him that Naoki has in fact taken an interest in Vanguard.\r\nThe next day at school, Aichi is shocked when his class gets a new transfer student: Kourin Tatsunagi from Ultra Rare.",

Then, Aichi gets an idea on how to promote Vanguard at his school. Because there is no Cardfight Club, Aichi decides to make one himself. The next day, he tries to recruit enough members to officially start the club (needing a minimum of five people, including himself) by handing out leaflets in front of the school. His pleas fall on deaf ears until Kourin agrees to be a member. Her enlistment is followed by several other boys who want to join (only to be with Kourin), but she proposes that anybody who wants to become club members will have to defeat either her and Aichi in cardfights before they can enter. The two easily beat all of the challengers, but then Naoki steps up to play against Kourin with honest feelings of wanting to join the club.\r\nWith a new Jewel Knight Royal Paladin deck, Kourin battles Naoki, who uses the Eradicator Narukami trial deck he bought a while ago. In the middle of the fight, Naoki reveals that he knew Aichi from when he was in the elementary school division of Miyaji Academy and how he felt guilty for not doing anything to help Aichi who was being bullied at the time. Naoki further explains that seeing how much Aichi has changed because of Vanguard motivated him to find something to be passionate about and ultimately change himself. In the end, Naoki defeats Kourin with the Break Ride ability of Eradicator, Vowing Sword Dragon. With that, Naoki is initiated into the newly-formed Cardfight Club, and Aichi's life in high school truly begins.",

This loss causes the football team's female cheerleaders to dump Ikki and the Vipers, which devastates them. Later, Naoki asks Ikki's motive for challenging the Cardfight Club, to which he answers that while he was bribed by the student council with a bigger budget for the football team, he mainly did it for the sake of playing against a strong cardfighter like Aichi.

Although Kourin applies a lot of pressure to him shortly into the fight, Daigo eventually gets a heal trigger and deals 5 damage to her, putting her in a tough situation. However, she is cheered on by Misaki and subsequently the audience to not give up. Kourin regains her composure and tries to end the game with the Limit Break of Leading Jewel Knight, Salome. Unfortunately, she does not do so. Daigo then uses White Dragon Knight, Pendragon's Limit Break to superior ride his new ace: Sanctuary Guard Dragon. He activates its Limit Break to overpower and defeat Kourin. Although the hero Kourin loses, Misaki, Aichi, Naoki, and Shingo all step up to challenge Daigo for their fallen friend. Daigo fakes being weakened by the club's strong bonds of friendship and then takes his leave. With that, the play ends with a happy ending and a round of applause from the audience. Aichi expresses his thanks for Daigo as a montage of Misaki's pictures (taken by Shin) during the play is shown.",

The first round pits Miyaji Academy against Hitsue High in a best-of-3 match. In the first game, Kai defeats Shingo, which puts Hitsue up 1-0.\r\nThe second game features Miwa vs. Misaki.

Misaki completely defends herself, but she is left with a weakened battle formation. Nonetheless, on her next turn, Misaki rides Goddess of Good Luck, Fortuna and reassembles her forces. She also activates Fortuna's Limit Break to perform three drive checks and manages to get two drive triggers to increase her overall power, ultimately winning the game and tying the score 1-1.\r\nFor the third and final game that will decide which team will advance through the tournament, Aichi and Izaki must fight each other.",

It is as if Aichi's existence has been completely erased. Kai goes to the room where the club would always meet and laments about Aichi but then remembers the Blaster Blade card. Suddenly, a Royal Paladin deck containing a new version of Blaster Blade appears before Kai. As he exits Miyaji Academy, Naoki stops him. As if reverting to his former self prior to meeting Aichi and playing Vanguard, Naoki asks about Kai's deck, which he responds by saying it is a Vanguard deck. Naoki shows slight signs of recalling everything, so Kai decides to play against him to jog his memory.\r\nKai and Naoki return to Card Capital where Misaki gives Naoki a Narukami trial deck to use for their fight. Kai goes over the rules of Vanguard with Naoki as they play. When Kai uses Blaster Blade Seeker, it triggers Naoki's memory, which helps him remember everything including Aichi. Forming a new friendship, Kai and Naoki make a vow to find Aichi. Misaki notes that their fight remains unfinished, but Naoki loses his motivation to keep playing after what just happened. So, Kai asks Misaki if she wants to fight (after noticing Misaki's intrigued look at Blaster Blade Seeker and showing hints of remembering Aichi), and she accepts.

The others let Chrono, who has surprisingly been working hard this whole time, go enjoy the festival for himself. In the midst of the festivities, Chrono sees Mamoru hard at work himself, doing tasks such as helping attendees, advertising other booths, and cosplaying as Vangaro. Chrono asks why a famous fighter like Mamoru would have festivals and do grunt work when there can instead be tournaments. Mamoru responds that festivals are great in gathering people together and teaching them about Vanguard, which he feels is more important than tournaments.\r\n\r\nThe festival's main event starts, in which players line up, form a group of three, and then simultaneously battle against Mamoru before the next group steps up to fight him. As reward for their work, Chrono and his friends are given special privilege to participate in this event, except Tokoha, who opts out of it. However, Kumi gets an emergency call and rushes back home while requesting Tokoha to take her place. Subsequently, it is time for the trio of Chrono, Shion, and a reluctant Tokoha to fight Mamoru. Nonetheless, like the other fighters before them, they are defeated but given a round of applause from the audience for their efforts. As the festival comes to a close, Chrono and Shion are glad to have fought Mamoru despite losing, and Tokoha invites them to folk dancing around a campfire.",

Since Team AL4 is currently out, Taiyou takes it upon himself to defend the branch by cardfighting Hiroki. As the battle continues, Hiroki spouts more of his ideals of how justice always wins, evil always loses, and evil must be punished. This reminds Taiyou of the old elitist philosophy of the branch and gives him more reason to defeat Hiroki. Unfortunately, not only does Taiyou lose, but Am (as Ace) summons one of the Zodiac Time Beasts and uses its power to destroy the branch. While there were no casualties, Taiyou is nonetheless disheartened that he could not defend the branch.",

The Story is cover during Junior High and Half of High School (Season 1, 2 and Half of Season 3).\r\nThe main protagonist Sendou Aichi, is a timid and mundane third-year middle school boy. The thing that supported Aichi's heart, was the \"Blaster Blade\" card that he received as a child. It's an important rare card from \"Vanguard\", a card game with the imaginary world of \"Planet Cray\" as its stage. From the day he reunited with the person who gave him that card \"Toshiki Kai\", Aichi's everyday life began to change.\r\n\r\nWhile expanding his horizons and meeting many different fighters, Aichi has a mysterious experience of hearing the voices of units from Planet Cray--- that closely resembles Psyqualia, the power held by \"Ren Suzugamori\", the leader of Team Asteroid.",
