    "SummaryEnglish": "The new \"slapstick\" story will depict Komugi-chan and her rivals as they juggle their daily lives as students, idols, and magical girls \"with laughter and tears.\"\r\n\r\nKomugi Yoshida is a somewhat clumsy second-year middle-school student whose strong point is her spiritedness. She performs as an idol like Kokona Saionji (her classmate and close friend) and Tsubasa Kisaragi (an idol who dresses in male clothing). However, unlike Kokona whose popularity is skyrocketing and Tsubasa with her charisma in male attire, Komugi's only gigs are low-end ones like those at the local shopping district. Still, Komugi has her \"dream\" as she lives her dual lives as a idol and a middle school girl.",
