Only those able to transcend the limits of the human condition can stand up to the mighty winged creatures. Ragna, a relatively weak young man, teams up with Léonica, an exceptional hunter who has already eliminated more Dragons than anyone. Only, following a tragic event, Ragna finds himself alone, driven by an insatiable thirst for revenge. Desperate to face and crush his enemies, he decides to team up with Crimson, a dark being who shares the same motivations as him: to eliminate the dragon monarchs for good.",
