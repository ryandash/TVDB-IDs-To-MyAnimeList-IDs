She is accepted into the illustrious Gokujou all-girl's school, and is summarily, almost curiously, accepted as part of the even more illustrious Best Student Council, who has more power and business ventures than most large businesses. Now a part of the student council, she befriends the talented members of the Best Student Council, leaving one to wonder how a girl with seemingly no talents or redeeming qualities would get chosen for such a group.",
