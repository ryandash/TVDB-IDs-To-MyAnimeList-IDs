    "SummaryEnglish": "Teaching, Mako thought, would be a walk in the park. With no overtime and long winter and summer vacations, she’d be able to easily save money for the day that she could retire – or so she thought. For Mako has been assigned to the worst of the worst, class 2-D of Ushi High, a group comprised solely of delinquents! In addition to having to tame these unruly boys Mako finds herself with another task as well – to become the new coach for the rugby team, at her principal’s request. Can Mako convince her boys to fight on the playfield instead of brawling in the streets?",
