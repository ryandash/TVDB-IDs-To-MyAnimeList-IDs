An ordinary home commute later sets the stage for Tomo and Mafuyu to discover an infirm boy named Alexander »Sasha« Nikolaevich Hel who later intercedes for her when the Magnesium Qwaser Pax Romania igniting the paintings in an attempt to scare insight out of Mafuyu instigates a battle that serves as a tutorial for defining Qwasers and their soma-synthesizing Maria partners along with demonstrating the necessity of soma in driving their chemistry-based powers over their assigned element; if that is not confusing enough for Mafuyu, Sasha is ultimately far more austere than his playful-sounding nickname suggests as he sees no reason to adhere to Miyuri's student government nor the standard social protocols of civilization.",

Waylaid with no practical recourse, Sasha explains Mafuyu about the »Tsar's Crowning« icon along with the fanatical zeal driving the Adepts' pursuit thereof. Mafuyu's opprobrium of all Qwasers being murderers strikes a nerve within Sasha whose languishing into unconsciousness after holding her at bay sets the stage for a glimpse of Sasha's prologue in refining his iron-based Qwaser powers and gives way to a dexterously prepared apology pot of borscht from Mafuyu. Teresa admonishing caution of Mafuyu prior to departing with Sasha is the only warning of an innocuous bathtime session of girl talk becoming the preamble for Ayana showing her true colors as the Magnesium Qwaser as she wields Tomo in an obverse abduction; the ultimate irony of the whole confrontation is that even with her powers energized by Tomo's soma, Sasha successfully turns the tables on Ayana using an iconoclastic strategy in spite of his rage.",

While Mafuyu bristles in frustration at Sasha's anti-social conduct and how he turned the tables on her that morning, Miyuri is shocked to have her overture rejected and her persecution perverted to her detriment yet again; later that evening, Mafuyu prepares a room for Sasha only to find that housing Sasha as per Father Yuri's volition is far easier said than done when he twice ignores her ground rules and nearly spears her with a »No spying!!!« projectile toss. Meanwhile, the Copper Qwaser Ekaterina Kurae is nearly finished with her voyage to Japan when a trio of gunmen charges her the relinquishment of her gynoid guardian Anastasia; a very violent »Leave me alone!!!« counterstrike on the three men gives way to Miyuri fawning over Ekaterina after her arrival in Japan prior to initiating the shopping spree whose ultimate irony is that it is the forum for Ekaterina to prove her hypothesis of Hana making an excellent Maria partner for her.",

A last-minute visit to a lingerie shop at Tomo's request for a bigger brassiere sets the stage for Tomo and Teresa's abduction at the hands of some voyeurs from the fitting room right under Mafuyu and Sasha's noses; a bit of detective work and an expedient »Put it in neutral!!!« intercession from Sasha later, the voyeurs are easily defeated but prove themselves a warm-up compared to the fully-charged Ekaterina who decides to appraise the efficacy of Hana's soma. Even with Teresa recharging his soma, Ekaterina easily stalemates Sasha's close-range attacks and would have finished him off if not for Mafuyu and Teresa's combined interjection for temperance; while Mafuyu and Teresa perform the necessary housekeeping with the voyeurs and explaining about Athos, Ekaterina ultimately makes herself at home in Hana's apartment as she wastes no time in refining Hana as her Maria partner.",

While taking a recess in the campus church, Father Yuri explains about Teresa's prologue as a orphan alongside Sister Wilma and how the Chlorine Qwaser Croa led his men in exterminating all of the nuns in her orphanage; Tomo now being wielded as a hostage, it becomes apparent that Croa is not hostile to the idea of finishing what he started a dozen years ago. The deus ex machina that ultimately conquers Croa's chlorine is some well placed calcium hydroxide bags and a copper shield courtesy of Ekaterina; as an unexpected bonus, Teresa also decides to reside with Sasha.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "The circumstances continue to deteriorate as the Adepts join forces with the Ancient Regime in a sort of tenuous unholy alliance as the Holy Aurum Qwaser declares the time is ripe to advance toward the »Tsar's Crowning«; almost if they had sensed this, Sasha and Mafuyu desperately search around for the Aquatic Sanctuary where the Icon is held only to find that there is a specific set of circumstances under which it can be found. The Hydrogen Qwaser Milk drawing a lot of attention due to her gas mask as she leads Jita Phrygianos through buying a cake in a store becomes the backdrop for Mutsumi and Tasuku to pick a fight with the two Qwasers while Friedrich abducts Mafuyu in order to avail the Sword of Maria elemental circuit within her body. Even with Hana's syllabus of Ekaterina being abruptly missing in action, Sasha is shocked to find the irony that Ekaterina is ultimately the most dangerous adversary on the scene as she threatens Mafuyu's life prior to the advent of the Aquatic Sanctuary; as if to rub salt in the wound, Ekaterina arrogantly decides to refuel herself with Mafuyu's soma caring nothing that the most power she will have in the Holy Roman Empire version 2.0 is as Friedrich's second-in-command.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Almost as soon as Ekaterina devotes herself to partaking of Mafuyu's soma, the Sword of Maria elemental circuit demonstrates the mechanics behind its immense power as Friedrich leads the charge with his brother Georg toward the Aquatic Sanctuary as he phases out with Ekaterina and Mafuyu along with two of the Adepts Qwasers certain that his subterfuge for the »Tsar's Crowning« will pay off. Tasuku and Elizabeth volunteer to stalemate Jita and Wang Chen's proximity injunction while Sasha intercepts the Tanner brothers as they are about to throw Mafuyu into the corrosive energy matrix surrounding the Sanctuary only to find to his horror that they are as deadly adversaries as they are devious scoundrels. The ironic silver lining in this confrontation is that the Tanner brothers' greed ultimately becomes their own worst enemy when their respective powers going out of control becomes the forum for Ekaterina to see the light as Hana repels Friedrich's chivalrous lechery before delivering a blistering reproof of Ekaterina's gullibility complete with a pair of »What the hell are you using for brains!?!« slaps across the chops; Sasha successfully destroying the Tanner brothers' combined avian form catalyzed by Ekaterina and Elizabeth's joint efforts along with those of Tasuku offers cold comfort to the Holy Aurum Qwaser ready to claim the spoils.",

Miyuri invites everybody to a bowling contest in which both Sasha and Jita prove to be comically unskilled, as oppossed to the class rep. Fumika who can successfully strike several times in a row. As part of her victory Sasha is to listen to anything she says, and while everybody thinks she's gonna confess her feelings for him, she from the embarrassment merely asks that Sasha gets along with everybody (namely in favor of Jita), which later prompts her to cry on Hana when she couldn't confess. The episode ends with Miyuri hugging the mysterious character named Edgar, who has found \"Sasha the Martyr\".",
