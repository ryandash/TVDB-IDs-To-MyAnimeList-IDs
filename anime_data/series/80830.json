When Alviss was about to die in King's hands, he saw Rolan and Phantom, who encouraged him to stand up and fight, and so did Bell (although she did not know they were there). Alviss sacrificed himself by holding King down so that his ÄRM a Baoa Qu could activate and blow King (along with him) up. King escapes, but Alviss is severely wounded. Before dying, Alviss uses the last of his magical power to activate the ÄRM that Ash left behind. When Dorothy, Ginta, and Babbo leave to go to the stolen Kaldean castle, Alviss thanks Bell and dies.",
