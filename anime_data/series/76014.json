Instead of tasting the bread, he throws it to a horse, who will eat it or reject it. He tells the two of them to make a bread delicious enough to be eaten by a horse. When they return to the store, Tsukino tells them his story - his sister nearly died from eating bread because of an unknown allergy to dairy. He therefore aims to make a bread that anyone, even someone with allergies, can eat. Horses will eat this type of bread because although they love wheat, they hate butter and dairy products.",

However, Ken tells Mokoyama Azuma is a much better baker, and he challenges the St. Pierre branch to a duel: Azuma's newest Japan against his new line. St. Pierre accepts, but the main Pantasia branch knows nothing about the challenge, or Azuma's new Japan, and their entire reputation is resting on their newest employee - especially since the duel will be broadcast on television.",

His bread, which is fried, seems to go over well with the judges; he took leftover bread and fried it in a special sauce to make it soft again. However, the judges note that it is made from leftovers, and that people will not want to eat it. In the nick of time, the general manager of Pantasia appears, and asks the judges to take price into consideration. Mokoyama announces that the price of his bread will be 190 yen, only slightly higher than a normal butter roll, which is a good deal because of the high quality ingredients. Then Azuma declares his price - 0 yen. This excites the crowd, and the judges give his bread a perfect score as well - it's a draw.",

However, Kawachi wants to do it on his own this time, so Tsukino suggests helping him get the legendary solar hands. Although confused as to how, Kawachi accepts the challenge. The special training is swimming - Kawachi is to swim many laps in a pool, with weights around his stomach. Kawachi goes into training, while Azuma decides to go to Izu to get an ingredient... by running. Izu is 3-5 hours away by train.",
