    "SummaryEnglish": "In Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan lives the Pants family, a family of pigs who love pants. Their family lineage has been charged with securing the world's most sacred pants for generations. Now, this mission has been entrusted to the son of the family, Panpaka. Along with his best friend, Punyan (a purple cat), the two travel around the world looking for various pants. During their adventures, they encounter various other allies with their own unique problems. What ensues are surreal comedic situations, most of the time ending with Panpaka and Punyan getting the \"special\" pants they were searching for, but with some disappointment.",
