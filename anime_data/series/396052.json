I might actually have a chance, don't you think?!\r\n\r\nOr so I thought, but then I heard that Shirokusa already has a boyfriend, and my life took a turn for the worse. I want to die. Why is it not me?! Even though she was my first love... As I was drowning in despair and depression, Kuroha whispered.\r\n\r\n—If it's that tough for you, then how about we get revenge?
