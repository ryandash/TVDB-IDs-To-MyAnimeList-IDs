Yamada enjoys riding with Kosuda on the water slide, but gets disappointed when she finds out Kosuda is afraid of heights, hence him clinging tightly to her. Kosuda manages to make up with Yamada during the fireworks display, when he hugged Yamada from out of the blue, taking Matsuo-senpai's suggestion. Now Yamada prepares for \"the big moment\" by buying tons of condoms, while Kosuda seems even scared to buy condoms for himself.",

Disappointed, Yamada runs out of the room after Kosuda finds the switch to the normal room lights, but he catches up with her in his bicycle and offers her a ride home.",

With Kosuda's gift of ear piercings, Yamada decoded this as a signal that they should look for a love hotel. Unable to find a cheap one, Yamada decides to go back down Love Hotel Lane to keep looking, until a nervous Kosuda attempts to kiss her, but his delays pissed a happy yet equally nervous Yamada off that she did the kissing herself, causing a massive headbutt. One way or another, Yamada's first kiss happened. Then her nervousness got the better of her that she ran away from Kosuda to hide somewhere.",

Even with Yamada and Kosuda having to hire their own boat (as they were left behind), their nervousness kept them from confessing to each other. In short, for them, the entire field trip was a waste and a disaster; and their only photo together was ruined by a rowdy, out-of-control Misato intruding (she was so rowdy she nearly ordered a beer, which was tantamount to expulsion).",

Only when both Yamada and Kosuda were appointed to the athletic meet committee were they able to talk and apologize to each other, nervousness and all, and despite Kosuda's denseness making Yamada angry. Yamada told Takeshita the news, but she only apologized in order to get laid, but Takeshita could see that she is in love with Kosuda. She is just running away because \"she does not understand love at all, since she expected it to be fun.\" Kyouka, on the other hand, is boiling mad because, counting their School Festival beauty contest, Yamada beats her for the second time.",

During tea Keiichi confesses to Yamada (and the more right now because he has heard from Kosuda that they are just dating), but gets rejected. However, her refusals get replaced by some deep thinking because, contrary to what she thinks of Keiichi, he is still a virgin (because Kyouka had all of those girls who have confessed to him terminated)--and that's what Yamada is looking for!

Kyouka has difficulty inviting her enemy Yamada, but it was solved when the latter demanded an invitation from her. The class, including their teachers, while awed by the party's grandness, finds it difficult to mingle with the rich people Kyouka also invited--save for Takeshita, who draws attention; and Misato, who lunges for Keiichi at will. Kyouka hears of this \"Secret Room\" thing from Misato, and she begins to suspect it could be her secret \"Brother Room.\" Kyouka's panic arouses Keiichi's attention, so, as a result, she tells Yamada and Kosuda to get going, although letting her go seems to be a mistake.",
