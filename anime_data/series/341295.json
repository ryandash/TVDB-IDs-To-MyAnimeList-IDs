                    "SummaryEnglish": "The fierce corpses are ordered to attack, but they only go for the Wen sect. Lan Wangji calls the technique sinister but deems the cultivator to be a friend instead of a foe. The deceased Wang Lingjiao starts to attack Wen Chao and Wen Zhuliu, and the cultivator finally descends upon their eyes. When he speaks, Jiang Cheng finds his voice familiar. The cultivator overpowers Wen Zhuliu as he is able to take his golden core and smash it into pieces. He then finally reveals himself to be Wei Wuxian, catching the three by surprise. Wei Wuxian continues using his dark abilities to kill both Wen Chao and Wen Zhuliu. With both dead, Lan Wangji warns Wei Wuxian of the price of pursuing demonic cultivation and fears that he will not be able to control it. But Wei Wuxian has already lost his past cheerful self and cannot detect Lan Wangji's act of kindness when the latter offers to take him back to Gusu. In the end, Lan Wangji leaves the battlefield in anguish as Wei Wuxian stays with Jiang Cheng. The brothers successfully take back Lotus Pier but continues to find a way to stop the rest of the Wen sect.",
