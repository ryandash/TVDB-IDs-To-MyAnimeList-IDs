For this she refuses Yamato's invitation to karaoke. However, because Asami has big breasts, she is being bullied at school, and Mei even stands up for her, at the cost of her cheek. Asami accompanies her to the clinic, though Yamato has bandaged it up prior. Kenji, who is heading for the clinic after being hit by a soccer ball in the face, catches the two bully girls inside the school clinic picking on Asami and defends her, though a little misunderstanding about her breasts and his bleeding nose made her run away. With some encouragement from Mei, Kenji eventually confesses his feelings for her. Meanwhile, bothered by the rumors, Mei secretly follows Yamato at the karaoke (where Arai is flirting with him in full throttle), and eventually feels how Yamato kisses the people he really cares for.

He then wastes no time in asking Yamato if he can hook him up with Mei for lunch with him. Yamato is unaware, though, that Kakeru has other designs for Mei, and, when Yamato was distracted by a phone call, he tried to convince her to be his girlfriend. But Mei sensed his motives and leaves him alone in an instant. Yamato learns of what happened, and when Kakeru starts badmouthing Mei, he punched him, saying she's his girlfriend. Kakeru tells Aiko about this the other day, but, despite being surprised about this development, she instead scolds him, that he will not be like Yamato. Mei appears to them, adding her impression of Kakeru. As he leaves in disgust, Mei, while recognizing Aiko's sacrifices, states that she is not giving Yamato up. Later, Yamato catches up with Mei, and confesses to her that he did sleep with Aiko, but only because back then she was heartbroken and lost. But he swears that he will never do it again with any girl, except if it is Mei.",
