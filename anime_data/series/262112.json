She tried putting it at the back of her mind, until, one night, when a stalker followed her on the way home from her part-time job. Deciding to hide in a convenience store, she tried calling home, but no one answers. She calls Yamato, who rushes to the scene despite being at karaoke with friends at that time. Yamato wards the stalker away by pretending to be Mei's boyfriend...complete with the \"I love you\" phrase and what eventually became Mei's first kiss.",

For this she refuses Yamato's invitation to karaoke. However, because Asami has big breasts, she is being bullied at school, and Mei even stands up for her, at the cost of her cheek. Asami accompanies her to the clinic, though Yamato has bandaged it up prior. Kenji, who is heading for the clinic after being hit by a soccer ball in the face, catches the two bully girls inside the school clinic picking on Asami and defends her, though a little misunderstanding about her breasts and his bleeding nose made her run away. With some encouragement from Mei, Kenji eventually confesses his feelings for her. Meanwhile, bothered by the rumors, Mei secretly follows Yamato at the karaoke (where Arai is flirting with him in full throttle), and eventually feels how Yamato kisses the people he really cares for. When Mei says that she loves him, Yamato kisses her \"for real.\"",

When the two girls are alone Aiko bluffs Mei into leaving him alone, but it was in vain as Yamato followed Mei on the way out. Yamato momentarily loses Mei, but knew where to find her. Eventually he shows Mei his middle school, where he sheds light on his past, about not caring about anybody else as a middle schooler, even with his best friend who was being bullied. He says it's him who is having a hard time blending with others. For this Mei, who herself needs to trust others, tells him to trust others, else he will lose friends. She decided not to go to the parlor anymore, after learning that trusting others makes people learn about others. Meanwhile, despite Aiko spending some time with Masashi in a love hotel, she has not given up on Yamato, yet.",

But Mei sensed his motives and leaves him alone in an instant. Yamato learns of what happened, and when Kakeru starts badmouthing Mei, he punched him, saying she's his girlfriend. Kakeru tells Aiko about this the other day, but, despite being surprised about this development, she instead scolds him, that he will not be like Yamato. Mei appears to them, adding her impression of Kakeru. As he leaves in disgust, Mei, while recognizing Aiko's sacrifices, states that she is not giving Yamato up. Later, Yamato catches up with Mei, and confesses to her that he did sleep with Aiko, but only because back then she was heartbroken and lost. But he swears that he will never do it again with any girl, except if it is Mei.",
