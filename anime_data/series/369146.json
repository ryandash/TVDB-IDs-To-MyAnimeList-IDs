    "SummaryEnglish": "Rin Namiki's mother was a champion in the sport of Jet Racing, a competitive form of jet skiing played on rivers using high-powered machines and two-woman teams. Now in high school, Rin is moving from the rural outskirts of Nagasaki to Tokyo to take up her mother's sport, but she's in way over her head, at least in terms of country versus city attitudes. This frustrates and annoys her roommate at the school dorms, another aspiring Jet Racer named Misa, and it only gets worse when Rin accepts a challenge from the top high school Jet Racer over rights to use the Kanda River. Can Rin prove that racing runs in her blood?",
