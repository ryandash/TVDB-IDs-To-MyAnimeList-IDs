    "SummaryEnglish": "The series is based on the manga and novel volumes, and sees the return of series regulars, Trish and Lady.\r\nIn the show, Dante runs his devil-hunting business, Devil May Cry, while struggling under constant financial debt. There are also two new regular charactersâ€”Dante's agent Morrison who visits frequently, and Patty Lowell, a young orphan girl he saved in the first episode, who also visits frequently and shares a sisterly relationship with Dante.\r\nWhile the show's stories were mostly self-contained, a season-long plot was introduced in the first episode and came to the forefront in episodes 10-12.",
