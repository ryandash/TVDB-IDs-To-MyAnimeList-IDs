The target of this plan is the New Energy Resource Research and Development Laboratory in Japan, where new minerals from across the galaxy are studied to discern their energy potential, but intrusion into their computer system is immediately detected by one alert scientist. The scientist heads down to the lab's computer centre, where he spots a sinister shadow interfering with the computer core. When he demands the person show themselves, however, the scientist is shocked when a giant robotic bat reveals itself and smashes through the wall to the outside. Peering out the hole left by the creature, the scientist watches as it attaches itself to the chest of a waiting Decepticon, who introduces himself as the fifth member of the Breastforce—Hellbat! The scientist sounds the alarm and Autobot and human troops come running, but in the course of the fight, stray shots from the Autobot troopers ignite fuel tanks on the laboratory complex. As the area begins going up in flames, Hellbat eschews any further physical combat in exchange for a swift getaway, and, with an eerie chant, unleashes a hypnotic sonic wave that makes his opponents fall unconscious.",

Deathsaurus sends Kakuryū to fetch Leozack, who is busy training with the other Breastforce members outside and debating with them why he summoned the back-stabbing Hellbat to Earth in the first place. Summoned before Deathsaurus, Leozack is instructed by his emperor to attack the Nevada spaceport. Leozack protests that two previous attacks on the facility have turned up nothing, but Deathsaurus insists, and Leozack is quick to realize that Hellbat has been sneaking around behind his back again. Infuriated at being made to look a fool, Leozack departs for the spaceport, but Hellbat follows him, defending his decision to keep the information from Leozack and winning his commander around with smarmy words.",

Blacker reports that although there has been a random, unfocused attack by the Dinoforce, there have been no sightings of the other Breastforce members. This, we soon learn, is because the Breastforce are all also on Micro, stewing aboard the Thunder Arrow and grumbling about Hellbat's self-serving scheming. Although Drillhorn, Jarugar and Killbison are all in favour of disposing of Hellbat, Leozack silences them with the reminder that they are about to get a new comrade, which will enable them to better keep an eye on the sneak. Hellbat chooses this moment to return to the Thunder Arrow, and is promptly accosted by his teammates and grilled over his recent operation with Blue Bacchus and Black Shadow. Luckily for him, he is able to weasel out of trouble by appealing to Leozack's sense of treachery and claiming that he was attempting to acquire a personal supply of energy for the Breastforce that would enable Leozack to attain his dream of one day overthrowing Deathsaurus. With that matter dealt with, he announces the Breastforce's latest plan—an attack on planet Micro's maximum security lunar prison, to free their old comrade, Gaihawk.",
