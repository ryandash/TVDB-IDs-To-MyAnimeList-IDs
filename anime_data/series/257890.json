Meanwhile, Chieri is awaiting the results, having said to Tsubasa that she wants to quit 00 if she is announced as she felt she didn't earn her votes, to which Tsubasa responded that if she is elected, she must tell the fans directly that she is quitting. The next set of places go to Sae, Tomochin and Kojiharu, whose speeches help Nagisa understand what the general elections are all about. Conflicted about what she should do, Chieri enters a panicked state when she is announced in sixth place. However, she overcomes her state to announce her love for her fans, saying that she'll continue doing her best. As the next set of places go to Mayuyu, Yukirin and Sayaka, Nagisa starts to have an unnerving feeling. Second place is awarded to Takamina, who gives her thanks to everyone who helped her get this far. Yuko is then announced as the winner, where she states her true goal is still to surpass Atsuko and become Center Nova. After the ceremony, Nagisa overcomes her fears and vows to face Chieri head on.",

As the concert begins, drawing out the DES forces, the understudies begin their mission and start gathering intel. During their investigation, Nagisa, Yūka and Makoto discover a hidden casino where elite members gamble on how long the concert will last. As they attempt to investigate further, Makoto inadvertently blows their cover. However, due to an apparent stroke of luck, they manage to escape to a garbage disposal and report their findings to Tsubasa. The girls decide to target the nuclear reactor hidden somewhere in the base so they can shut down the casino and escape, with Orine's team using a stolen mech to help them. As Makoto laments her usefulness, Higashino, the DES guard that helped them escape, gives her his support and helps her to shut down the reactor, gaining her own Kirara in the process.",
