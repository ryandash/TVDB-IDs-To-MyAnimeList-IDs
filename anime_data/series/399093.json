    "SummaryEnglish": "An old man named Jiya brings a new recruit, a modest penguin named Manmaru, to join in on a 300-year battle between the three Ninja clans living in the mountains he owns. But the others, the cowardly Tsuenjiro (fox) and quick-tempered Tanutaro (racoon), are disappointed when they learn the newest trainee is nothing other than a polite, if not flaky penguin. And not just any penguin, but a penguin with dreams to become a professional soccer player.",
