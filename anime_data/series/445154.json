    "SummaryEnglish": "A teen named Luo Lie is picked by chance to travel to the Other World and live with someone else’s identity. Both major and minor separatist regimes are present in the Other World, danger lurking in every corner. With his determination and the mysterious ability obtained during the soul travel, the home-sicked Luo Lie overcomes numerous obstacles in the turbulent situation. He goes beyond his limits, turning himself into a well-known figure. However, being in a constantly precarious circumstance, cunning schemes are closing in on him. With the help of his childhood sweetheart, who put her life at risk for his sake, Luo Lie, who had no intention of becoming a hero, unexpectedly embarks on the path to becoming one. What awaits him ahead? Is it an irreversible abyss or the light at the end of the tunnel?\r\n- Youku.tv",
