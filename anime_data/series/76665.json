                    "SummaryEnglish": "The story begins in the Spirit World, where the River Styx is overflowing, due to a tsunami. But as Koenma looks out his window he can tell this is no ordinary storm. The floodwaters continue to rise, and just before they become too much for Koenma he gives a mysterious item to Botan, and tells her to give it to Yusuke Urameshi. But Botan gets hurt badly and barely makes it to Yusuke. Botan is too weak to give Yusuke the item. Throughout most of the movie she’s unconscious and is unable to do anything, while a great evil is surfacing. The storm was apparently caused by the forces of the Netherworld, which was banished into cold space ages ago. All this happens pretty quickly, and so does the fighting. We get to see Yusuke and the others do their signature attacks, against some of their toughest opponents yet. To restore balance in the now flooded Spirit world, Yusuke and the others must track down five spots on Earth that contain a large amount of spiritual energy. But their simple plans get turned upside down when the ruler of the Netherworld, Yakumo, and his three henchmen decide to use the same energy for evil. So, the race begins to save the Spirit World, and now the Human World as well.",

When Roto grows bored of the torment, and raises his foot and tells Kurama to lick the slime off, though, Kurama declines, and Roto threatens to press the button.
