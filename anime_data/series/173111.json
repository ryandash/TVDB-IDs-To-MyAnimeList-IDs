At his house they encounter Mitamura, but Sara becomes jealous of the interaction between Fujita and Mitamura. The next day, they out to play golf, so Sarah drives to Aozora City alone and buys an old kaleidoscope at a market. Fujita thinks it may be a Brewster's kaleidoscope but, angry at Fujita and Mitamura, she doesn't want to share it. Mitamura challenges Sara to compete in a half marathon to be held the next day for access to the kaleidoscope. During the race Sara's animosity dissipates, but on a whale-watching cruise, Sara loses the kaleidoscope overboard and becomes downhearted. Mitamura encourages Fujita to spend time with Sara, so he takes her to an observatory at Mauna Kea to view the stars in the night sky.",

The same day, Fujita visits Parker, an old colleague, and gave him some special glue for restoring Japanese paintings. In return, Fujita asks to be able to view the European paintings alone. Meanwhile, Norman the director, shows Mr. Richardson, wealthy businessman around the exhibit, seeking sponsorship. Richardson does not know much about art, although his son studied and wrote about Rubens. Fujita encounters Richardson who asks him for a tour of the museum, and Fujita obliges. He introduces Richardson to the people involved in running the museum, many of whom call him \"the Professor\". Richardson confides that his only son died recently and he feels that people are circling like hyenas to get his money. Just then, the director finds them and reprimands Fujita for being on the premises. Later, Richardson donates $3 million to the museum, saying he was impressed by the work of the people there.",
