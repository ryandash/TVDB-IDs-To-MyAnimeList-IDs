Tomoe comes for Miyabi for her protection from K, only to be shocked as she not only Miyabi hurts her, she also learned from Lilith over her brainwashing. Unable to stand K's mockery, Tooru is going to attack K but instead he is confronting Miyabi. Meanwhile during the Reign Conference, Equipment Smith is gloating by telling Sakuya, who realized that he has been keeping an eye onto the girl who was desperately gaining Tooru's attention, that Miyabi is his best creation. Elsewhere, Tomoe is confronting Miyabi despite suffering her injury from her beating. In an attempt to convince Miyabi to give up her destructive strength, she tells her friend that not even Tooru wishes to see her current state, causing Miyabi to be snapped and attacking her. However, Tomoe tells Miyabi that she would be. Elsewhere, even learning Miyabi's freedom from the mind control, K proceeds defeating the duo by hurting Julie, leading to Tooru's immediate rescue while suffering injuries from K's squad's gun shots.",
