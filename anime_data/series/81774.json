    "TitleEnglish": "Pucca",
    "SummaryEnglish": "\"Pucca\" is a TV series based on a Flash animation series published by Vooz Character Systems.  It follows the trails and exploits of a South Korean girl named Pucca who is insanely in love with a prideful ninja named Garu.  Meanwhile, Garu and Pucca help their town of Sooga Village out when evil ninjas attack, as well as diffuse a lot of the absurd situations that frequently plague the town.  This show could best be described as a cleaned-up version of South Park meets Looney Tunes meets Naruto.  \r\n\r\nThere is some very subtly hidden adult humor; but most of the adult jokes would not go noticed by small children, who are the primary audience.",
