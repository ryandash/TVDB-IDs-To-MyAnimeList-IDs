They arrive at a strange dojo where they meet a man named Jinlon, who guards the sealed dragon Number. As Jinlon mentions that he knows of Mizar, Astral reveals his findings to the other, believing that the Barian Emperors were once human long ago. Kite then challenges Jinlon to a duel with their dragons on the line, with Jinlon summoning his number, Number 46: Dragluon, also summoning out Protector Dragon, which keeps Dragluon from being attacked. When Kite summons Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon, its effects are negated by Dragluon, but Kite manages to use other means to destroy Protector Dragon. As Mizar arrives at the bottom of the structure, Jinlon uses Dragluon's ability to summon Drain Dragon, which uses its effect to add Kite's life point value to its attack points, raising its attack points to 8000. Drain Dragon also has an effect that deals half of its ATK points as damage when it is destroyed.",

When the village wanted to sacrifice Dragluon to ward off rainy weather, Mizar prepared to sacrifice himself to save Dragluon, but they were both struck down by the king's army. Mizar overhears this legend and denies it, preparing to fight against Kite. However, their resonance causes the dojo to collapse, forcing Mizar to retreat.

Girag, having returned to the human world, also sees the report and gets to the statue before Yuma and his friends.

When Yuma and company finally arrive, they are surprised to see that the tanuki spirit, Ponta, is in control of Girag's body while Girag himself is in the statue. Ponta is in fact the Number's Guardian, and Yuma challenges him to a duel with the Number card and Girag at stake. After Xyz Summoning Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu, Ponta temporarily possesses Yuma and proceeds to waste all of Yuma's cards in a series of misplays. Nonetheless, Yuma manages to win the duel and claim the Number. It is revealed that in the legend of Girag, Ponta was just a stray animal picked up by Girag and had the ability to transform himself into a duplicate of Girag, allowing Ponta to act as his double for battles. However, Ponta was betrayed by Girag, who sent him away before a big battle, making Ponta angry, and his spirit had been sealed in the statue ever since then. Girag defends himself by saying that he drove Ponta away because he knew he was entering a losing battle, and he wanted Ponta to stay alive. Girag, in spirit form, then bursts out of the statue and swallows Ponta, reclaiming his body. He then departs back to Barian World, with Ponta's spirit resting inside him.",

Escaping thanks to Rainbow Kuriboh, Yuma receives a message from Kazuma, telling him to save Astral. Meanwhile, Shark, who is conflicted between his childhood memories and Barian memories, is approached by Dumon, who reveals to Shark that he is one of the Seven Barian Emperors, Nash. Yuma is rescued by an Astral being named Ena, who states Yuma can use the power of Chaos to restore the damage done to Astral World, and help its people fight against Eliphas, who has put the town under his control. With Ena's help, Yuma finds where Astral is laying, with Eliphas standing in his way. As the two begin to duel, Eliphas summons his Xyz monster, New Order 4: Etheric Anubis, while Yuma summons Utopia. However, Yuma is soon pushed into a corner when Eliphas exhibits the ability to perform a Shining Draw.",
