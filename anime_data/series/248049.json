The Student Council President, Carlyle Chesterton, who is under Girag's command, assigns Caswell as a \"Special Disciplinary Commander\", who begins enforcing harsh rules on the students. As Yuma decides he has had enough and confronts Carlyle, he challenges him to a duel, with Caswell as the referee, throwing in all sorts of rules which obstruct Yuma's dueling. Carlyle summons his Xyz Monster, Norito the Moral Leader, and deals some damage to Yuma, though he manages to find a workaround to Caswell's rules. As Caswell laments how he isn't class president anymore, Yuma reminds him of his true self, allowing him to throw away the role of disciplinary commander. Carlyle then uses Barian's Force to upgrade Norito into the Chaos Xyz monster, Saimon, the Great Moral Leader, but Yuma manages to bring out Utopia and win the duel. Afterwards, Yuma relinquishes his role as class president back to Caswell while Girag finds a new target to put under his control.",

Using the special ability of Heart-eartH Chaos Dragon, Dark Mist raises his Life Points to 7,500, while Yuma only has 500 Life Points remaining. Being unwilling to give up, Yuma and Astral merge into ZEXAL II, and bring out Utopia Ray and two new Zexal Weapons: Sleipnir Mail and Asura Blow. This allows Yuma to overpower Number 96's monsters and defeat him. In a last-ditch attempt, Number 96 uses the last of his strength to try and take over Astral's body, but Astral chooses to sacrifice himself to destroy Dark Mist, leaving Yuma horrified. This action severely drains Astral and forces him to retreat to Astral World, and he entrusts Yuma with the Numbers they obtained, before fading away.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "As Yuma remains reclused following Astral's disappearance, Don Thousand gives Vector the remnants of Number 96's power, who is revealed to be a shard of Don Thousand's malice that was trapped inside of Astral, during Astral's ancient battle with Don Thousand. Number 96 is also revealed to be a \"Forbidden Number.\" Then, Don Thousand reveals his plan to use his new powers from Number 96 to make multiple Dimension Fusing Devices, to merge the Human World with Barian World, once the level of evil in the Human World reaches that of Barian World. This would increase Don Thousand's power by a thousandfold, giving him enough power to destroy Astral World. In order to create more Dimension Fusing Devices, Don Thousand emerges from Vector's body in a black energy form resembling his true likeness, and fuses Vector to his throne, in order to concentrate their energy on making more Dimension-Fusing Devices. Then, using his newly enhanced powers, Vector returns Mr. Heartland to his human form, grants him four Fake Number cards, and gives him a group of 3 Barian servants, who, along with Mr. Heartland, make up the Fearsome Four of the Dark Dueling World. Mr. Heartland distributes 3 of the Number cards among the other members of the Fearsome Four, while he keeps Number 1. Soon afterwards, a servant named Semimaru begins attacking duelists and stealing their memories. When Tori and the others try looking into the incident to cheer Yuma up, they are caught by Semimaru, who steals their memories and uses them as bait to lure Yuma into a duel. Heartland attempts to coerce Yuma into giving up his Numbers to save his friends, but he remains determined to cling onto the Numbers that Astral had left him. He is soon joined by Trey, who offers to support Yuma in a 2-on-1 duel against Semimaru. However, Mr. Heartland uses Don Thousand's power (which manifests in a crest-like form of Don Thousand's Barian Emblem) to activate a field effect, which puts Yuma and Trey at a distinct disadvantage",

However, Semimaru deals a lot of damage to Trey, who took the hit for Yuma, and activates a trap that would ensure Yuma's victory on his next turn. As Yuma struggles to think of a comeback, Tori and the others regain some of their memories and show their support, reminding Yuma that he is not alone. Yuma then sets the stage for Trey to summon Number 6: Chronomaly Atlandis, equip it with Utopia, and use Atlandis to win the duel, destroying Semimaru and returning Tori and the others to normal.
