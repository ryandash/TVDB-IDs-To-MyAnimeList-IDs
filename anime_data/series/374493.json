When they ask him why, he says that he's moving with his parents to the US. With that, he won't be able to return to Japan. The club shows how lonely they'll be without him, but there's no time to feel down in the dumps! They plan him a farewell party for him, where they'll tell ghost stories while having sweets and soft drinks. Who tells ghost stories at a farewell party...? Mataro puts on his straight man act in reaction, but he has plenty of Yo-kai memories to tell with his Y Academy memories. Let's gather around and talk together!",
