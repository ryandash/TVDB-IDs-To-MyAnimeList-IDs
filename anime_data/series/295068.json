                    "SummaryEnglish": "Goku and Jiren exchange attacks continuously. Despite almost being defeated twice, Goku stands up and recovers. Goku regains the edge over Jiren once again. When Jiren asks why Goku refuses to surrender, both Goku and his friends claim that the source of Goku's strength comes from the trust between him and his companions. Refusing to accept this and implications of his impending defeat, an enraged Jiren launches an attack on the bleachers in a desperate attempt to prove that friendship is meaningless. However, the attack is repelled by a furious Goku, who powers up even further and finally defeats Jiren. However, just as Goku is about to knock Jiren out, his body collapses from the strain of using Mastered Ultra Instinct for too long. Despite this opportunity, Jiren hesitates in knocking Goku off the tournament stage.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "While Frieza takes the lead in the attack, Android 17 manages to injure Jiren with another surprise attack, who collapses from exhaustion. Frieza is about to eliminate Jiren, who accepts his impending defeat, but Top calls out to Jiren and inspires him to keep fighting despite his injuries. Jiren powers up into his limit-breaking state again and fires a massive blast at Frieza and Android 17. They form an energy barrier to shield themselves. Before Jiren can overpower them, Goku manages to get back up and rejoins the others. Goku adds his strength to the barrier, which enables them to cancel out Jiren's blast. Working together, Goku and Frieza overpower Jiren and tackle him off the tournament stage, which eliminates Goku, Frieza, and Jiren from the Tournament of Power. With all of their fighters defeated, Universe Eleven is erased. As the only fighter remaining on the tournament stage, Android 17 is declared the winner of the Tournament of Power.",
