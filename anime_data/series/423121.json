    "SummaryEnglish": "Following a fatal road accident, our protagonist suddenly finds himself transported to another world, and wakes up with the inability to move, near a mysterious lake. Very quickly, the observation is alarming: our man no longer hears his own voice and worse still: when he tries to scream in fear, the words that come out of his mouth are not the ones he wanted to say. “One product purchased, the second is free! In reality, our hero has turned into a vending machine, and the only actions he is able to perform are limited to those of a simple machine. In such a context, how will he manage to survive in this fantasy world?!",
