The girl is really Inukashi in disguise, as this was a part of a plan devised by Shion, Nezumi, Inukashi and Rikiga. Inukashi, unable to deal with the man's advances, disrupts the facade in outrage. Nezumi and Rikiga bind and gag the man in order to get information from him, while Shion consoles Inukashi. The information they receive entails a map of the correctional facility in No. 6, as well as word of a \"pre-Holy Day cleaning operation\". Back at their underground hideout, Shion discusses potential plans of their living conditions when the summer comes, idealizing that his mother and Safu live here together with him and Nezumi. Meanwhile, Karan walks through a festive No. 6, as the inhabitants are preparing for the Holy Day. Back in the outskirts of the city, Shion asks Nezumi if he sent a message to his mother because he had finally come up with a plan. Suddenly, the town is attacked by No.6 military tanks, which Shion discovers were part of the \"cleaning operation\" he had asked Nezumi about earlier. The two flee to seek shelter from the raid, and in an alley, Shion finds an infant whose mother was killed by the blasts. He sends their guard dog off with the baby to Inukashi. The army then rounds up all the town's survivors, telling them they will be taken to the correctional facility--which had been Nezumi's plan all along. Meanwhile, Karan frets about Shion's safety, but Yoming assures her that Shion is fighting back and not to worry. He also informs her that the Twilight House was established to kill off all unneeded people of the city's elderly population, and that he will be sending out a message to his comrades to fight back against No. 6. Karan then receives a message from one of Nezumi's rats, telling her that she will be reunited with Shion. In the transport trucks, Nezumi sings an old song to raise the hopes of the captured townsfolk, but tells Shion that a song will never",

Yoming is setting up his plans with his other friends, waiting for a perfect time to act. Suddenly, the parasites become active and people start dying very rapidly. The parasite bees are everywhere, millions of them. Back at the facility, one of the dead researchers on the floor gets a phone call, and it plays the frantic message of another researcher saying that their plans had gotten out of hand. Nezumi asks Safu if she was truly the one who led them there, and when she responds saying that she wanted to see them, Nezumi says that she has \"Mother's\" voice. Mother is the main computer behind Safu, which controls the entire correctional facility. Safu says that Mother was held in the Moon Drop until four years before when the authorities captured Nezumi and took him to the Moon Drop. She says that the researchers had planned to use Mother to analyze Nezumi so they could learn Elyurias' power and use it to revive the land they had destroyed. She tells them that the researchers had used the information they had received from the legless man to experiment Elyurias' power on the citizens of No. 6, thus the parasite bees. At this time, Yoming starts to broadcast to the city, though many people are already dead. Sion doesn't understand Safu, so Nezumi tells him that Safu is really Elyurias. Safu admits to it, and tells Sion that she loves him. As Sion starts to lose control of himself, Safu tells Nezumi to destroy Mother. After having to fight back against Sion, Nezumi puts an explosive on Mother and the two escape, leaving Safu behind to die. Sion is hysterical, but Nezumi tells him that she's not Safu",
