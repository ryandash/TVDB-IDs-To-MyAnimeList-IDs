It seems that in most of the worlds where she has been her disappearance has not left any major problems — except for the three who have been pursuing her across worlds. She then tries to set things right. Gargantua finally realizes that it is Ritsuko that he loves rather than Jill. He rescues her from her cell and reshapes his world into a bright and cheerful one where he and Ritsuko, who seem to have been made immortal by the Door of Eve, can live together happily ever after.",

Alone again, Hazuki reflects on her dreamlike adventures, but suddenly sees Hatsumi returning to the house. History repeats itself, like a universe reset, but Hatsumi does not glow and disappear at the stroke of midnight. Instead Hatsumi and Hazuki share a passionate kiss and then a cuddle. Hazuki awakens the next day not remembering anything, but notices the signs of Hatsumi's future rebirth as her child.",
