Whisper tries to explain his mistake, but Semimaru insists he is a Yo-Kai. He reveals that when a cicada dies after its one week in its adult stage, it transforms into Semimaru, but Semimaru only ever just wants to turn back into a cicada once more, burying itself, because if it leaves the ground again it will never become a cicada again. Keita reminds him he is above ground, and Semimaru freaks out. Whisper tries to look up ways to extend the life on Yo-Kai UkiUkipedia, but the countdown does not end. Instead, Semimaru tries to live life to its fullest. The week ends, and Semimaru gives Keita his Yo-Kai Medal, and as the countdown finally ends, he falls down. However, he is just asleep.

Komasan becomes distressed that he can help her out, but cannot.

Keita scans for a Yo-Kai and finds what he believes to be a tengu, but he claims he is not, and Whisper identifies him as Nekurama Tengu, a Yo-Kai who makes people gloomy with his fan's wind and he has possessed his friends. Keita asks Jibanyan to defeat him, but both he and Whisper are possessed. Keita takes the Yo-KaiPad and discovers the way to defeat Nekurama Tengu is to make him happy, but not even the dancing seaweed Yo-Kai team of Wakame-kun, Konbu-san, and Mekabu-chan can make him give up. Whisper reveals that a game of sushi Russian roulette may work, with one piece of sushi having too much wasabi, but Jibanyan accidentally makes them all that way, which finally makes Nekurama Tengu crack a smile, which frees Jibanyan and Whisper, but not Keita's friends.
