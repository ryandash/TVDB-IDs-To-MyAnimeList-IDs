As they reached the final fence, a squirrel suddenly appeared in front of them and Andrews went to a panic, threw Vivian to the ground. Humiliated, Vivian lashed Andrews with a whip. Andrews went to a wild frenzy and escaped to the city. Lynn and Paul, who happens to pass by, went after Andrews. They managed to find Andrews at the entrance hall of a building. Lynn slowly approached the panic-stricken Andrews and managed to settle it down. As the people cheered, behind them, Vivian was infuriated by Lynn's heroic actions. After the incident, Lynn went home to the mansion and was delighted to her family - her elder sister Sarah and her father George, again. She told them her adventures earlier today, but as time passed Sarah and George have to go away and leave Lynn to Countess Montgomery's care. Lynn is hoping that one day they will be together again.",
