    "SummaryEnglish": "Sotobamura is a small village with around 1300 inhabitants. It is a village which is connected to not even a single highway. An isolated village in which old customs, such as the burial of the dead, are still practiced.\r\n\r\nOne day, the corpses of 3 persons are found. Although Ozaki Toshio, the village's lone doctor, feels uncertain, he treats the deaths as normal occurrences. However, in the days following, the villagers die one after the other.\r\n\r\nIs this mere coincidence, an epidemic, or something else entirely?",

Eventually, as the mysterious deaths start piling up, Motoko's father-in-law dies. Her mother-in-law refuses to let Toshio perform an autopsy on the body, claiming that doctors care about the money more than their patients. Eventually Motoko's husband dies; then, her daughter falls ill. Slowly losing her sanity, Motoko carries her daughter over to the Ozaki clinic; however when she arrives, the clinic is closed (because Toshio is conducting experiments on his risen shiki wife.) She then rushes over to the Kanemasa clinic, which is also closed during the daytime. Motoko's mother-in-law shows up and scolds her for shaming herself in public, and states that her daughter is fine.",
