Aiolia heals Seiya's leg with his cosmo and tells the Bronze Saints what they will face on the sixth Temple: Virgo Shaka, the Saint whose power is the closest of God's. Meanwhile, at the Canon Island, some soldiers from the sanctuary are torturing the villagers, in order to find out where is Phoenix. Ikki shows up and defeats all the soldiers, but two enemies appear from nowhere. They are Peacock Shiva and Lotus Agora, both disciples of Shaka and ordered by him and the Pope to kill Ikki. The battle begins, but Phoenix's abilities are being blocked by the Virgo Saint's cosmo. Shiva and Agora attack Ikki at will, and he can't do nothing about it. Meanwhile, Seiya, Shiryu and Shun are running to the sixth Temple, and Shun wonders why he keeps hearing his brother's scream in his head...",

The same happens with Shiryu and Shun, and finally Shaka defeats all of them with his technique: TenMaKou Fuku (Devil Lord's Blessing). When Shaka is about to kill Shun, a Phoenix Feather cuts his hand. Phoenix Ikki has arrived. Since Ikki hurt Shaka's hand, the Gold Saint creates a river of blood, where Ikki will drown unless he gives up and becomes a follower of Shaka, but Ikki uses his flaming cosmo to vaporise the blood river.\r\nHowever, Ikki still can't attack Shaka, who paralises him the same way as before. Then, Shaka uses his Rikudo Rinne (Cycle of the Six Worlds) attack, sending Ikki's spirit to the nothingness.",

Shaka destroys the Phoenix's Cloth with his powerful cosmo and attacks Ikki with Rikudo Rinne again. Ikki can't evade it, and his body is burnt to ashes. However, he reappears again with his immortal cloth. Shaka uses his last resource: The TenbuHorin (The Treasure of the Heaven) attack. To use this attack, Shaka does what the saints most feared: he opened his eyes, unleashing his full power and destroying Ikki's cloth again, and the first sense of Ikki: the touch. Shaka explains that the TenbuHorin destroys the five senses of the opponent one by one, and so he does with Ikki, destroying the smell sense.

Seiya and Shiryu regain their consciousness. Shaka understands that Ikki's brain and heart are still 100% active, and that's why Ikki's still conscious and fighting, so he uses the TenbuHorin again to destroy Ikki's brain.\r\nShun challenges Shaka again, but Ikki is not dead yet.
