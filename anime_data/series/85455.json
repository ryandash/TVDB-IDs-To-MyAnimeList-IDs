Just then, there is an explosion of some sort, and everyone turns to look at Mao.

No one knows how Mao is managing to do it, not even Chouyu.\r\n\r\nIt is then noticed that Leon is getting a severe frostbite on his hand, because of the bitter cold that the knife is producing.

The judges take a slice of porgy each and dip it in a sauce, and are instantly taken over by the wonderful taste. \r\n\r\nLate in the evening, Mao finishes his dish, the 'Resurrection Spring Rolls' . The judges are amazed that Mao managed to keep the taste of the porgy at its highest stage.

Normally, the sauce takes months to mature but the powers of the Coiled Dragon Pot shorted the process to seconds.\r\n\r\nBidding their farewell to Sanche, they leave Shanghai to continue their journey. They stumbled upon a group of traveling acrobats. After a night of good food and wine, they fell asleep. When they awoke, the acrobats were gone and they found themselves cornered by the local minister’s men. Shell was arrested for robbery and sentenced to death on the same evening.\r\n\r\nWhen Leon went to look for the real culprits, Mao devised a cunning plan to delay the execution. As the minister was going the execution, Mao cooked noodles and fanned the aroma to attract the minister (Mao found out earlier from the kitchen that the minister loved noodles). Using 100 different spices to concoct flavoured noodles and soup and using them in different combinations and small portions, it made sure that the kept the minister’s appetite in high gear. Mao calls the dish: The Chamelen Bowl Tower.\r\n\r\nWhen the minister finally realized something wrong, he arrests Mao. As he was executing Shell, he was interrupted. It was Shell! The person who was about to be executed was the real culprit (mistaken for Shell as he disquised himself during the robbery to frame shell). Leon had succeeded in capturing the culprits after all. It turns out that the minister was in the mastermind and executed innocent people to cover his tracks. The minister was arrested and Shell was freed.",
