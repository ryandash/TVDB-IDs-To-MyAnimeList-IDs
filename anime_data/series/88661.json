Li-Ren was somehow motivated by Carl's words and simultaneously learns of King Mahaty's grieve condition. Kajika, Fred and Harry heads to Ranginei to visit Mahaty. Kajika who meets her biological grandfather for the first time was motivated to go all the way and fight for her love after listening to Mahaty's words. Rumaty on the other hand is surprised to find out that Kajika is his blood related cousin. After the meet, Kajika tells Harry that she wants to cut ties with him in order to be able to leave out the Burnsworth name and find Li-Ren again. Harry agrees instantaneously although he seemed rather shocked at first. Harry also states that he will only be giving Kajika the Gibori Island, which made Kajika rather happy. Toranosuke was told by Harry that his contract is up but he was persistent on continuing to follow and help Kajika at his own free will. Outside of the Ranginei Palace, when Kajika was trying to borrow money from Toranosuke for the taxi and air fare for her journey to Singapore, Eugene appears to be waiting for Kajika and asks Kajika what she really wants at this instant. Kajika tells him that she wants Li-Ren and Eugene states that since that is what she wants, that is what he'll be giving her (Li-Ren).",

Li-Ren tells Zao that he won't be able to do anything now that Li-Ren has allowed Fi to be the Head of Huang. Li-Ren points a gun to Zao stating that both of them should wait whilst the Elders decide what to do with Li-Ren but as Zao was to command his personally hired bodyguards to his aid, Liutenant Noei, sent by Rumaty to help Kajika, appears together with his comrades to save Li-Ren from being held captive in his mansion in Singapore. A great deal of damage was done to the Huang family's property but Noei told Zao to send the invoices to Rosenthal Corp as Carl Rosenthal had offered to pay for the losses. Engene's personal helicopter then flew just outside Li-Ren 's balcony and Kajika opened the copter's door. She told Li-Ren to decide whether to stay on or follow her and he decides to follow Kajika. Kajika then told him that she'll not let go of Li-Ren. Toranosuke who was then manuovering the helicopter asks Kajika where she is headed too next as there is a plane already waiting for her in the airport. She says that she wishes to go back to the Giboro Islands and Eugene was interested to follow her. Li-Ren was slightly jealous and questioned Eugene's decision. Eugene naughtily told Li-Ren that he could get off his personal copter if he wasn't happy about it. The unhappy yet childish side of Li-Ren surfaced when he silently said to himself that he had a helicopter too. Kajika on the other hand was elated that both Li-Ren and Eugene(Mustafa) will be joining her in the Giboro Islands but she first told Toranosuke to head off to Ranginei as she wants her dying grandfather, Kind Mahaty to meet her husband Li-Ren. Back in Ranginei, both Harry Burnsworth and Rumaty have a good chat. Harry says that Kajika should be arriving soon and Rumaty was quite delighted at his Uncle's opti",
