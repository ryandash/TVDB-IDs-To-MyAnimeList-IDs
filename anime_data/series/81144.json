    "SummaryEnglish": "Shinichiro is a student living in what would be a dream come true for most high school boys, but for him is mostly a frustration. A well liked girl in school named Hiromi has lived in his house for a year along with his family. Her father was a close friend of the family, and when he died they immediately took her in. She is popular and well liked, always smiles, is talented in sports- but Shinichiro knows there must be tears inside her. Having an artistic tendency, he makes watercolors of her and thinks about wishing to ease her tears. Yet he cannot bring up the nerve to talk to her even in his own home. She, too, is quiet and withdrawn in their house, quite unlike at school. Shinichiro is also distracted by teasing from his friend Nobuse for watching Hiromi from afar, a curse of bad luck from a strange girl named Noe, and being forced to perform Muhiga dancing. By helping Noe he hopes to ease his own problems, yet he seems to have difficulty helping himself.\r\n[taken from Anime News Network]",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "The day after the festival, Shinichirō goes to Jun to apologize for Noe's broken leg, though Jun says he will not forgive him. Jun later sees Hiromi and breaks it off with her, saying that he never loved her, not even a little bit. Shinichirō decides to show his picture book to Noe, but she refuses, so he says he is going to throw it into the sea, which he does by ripping out the pages and making them into paper airplanes. Noe interferes and they manage to recover all but the last page, but Noe looks at the rest of them. Shinichirō and Noe part with him telling her that while he is in love with Hiromi, his heart wavers when he looks at Noe. Shinichirō goes to see Hiromi at night and tells her that he will always be with her. Several months later in the spring, Noe is finally able to shed tears for the first time in years.",
