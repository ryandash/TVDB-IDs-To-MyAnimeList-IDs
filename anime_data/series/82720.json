        "eng": "Revolves around high school student Haruhiko Amami and his strong connection to Gift's mysterious power. The town of Narasakicho, where Gift's story takes place, has two distinguishing characteristics: a rainbow that seems permanently fixed in the sky no matter the weather, and an ability known as Gift possessed by all its inhabitants. Gift's power can only be evoked by each person once in a lifetime, and is able to grant a single miracle. To be successful, a Gift must reflect the shared feelings of both the giver and the receiver. If the feelings are not mutual, the Gift is distorted and has the ability to wreak havoc on the surrounding area. When this happens, a black streak appears in the rainbow above town until Gift is used correctly.",
        "jpn": "高校生の奄美晴彦とギフトの不思議な力との強いつながりを中心に展開。 ギフトの物語が繰り広げられる奈良崎町の町には、天候に関係なく恒久的に空に固定されているように見える虹と、住民全員が持つギフトという能力の2つの特徴があります。 贈り物の力は、一生に一度だけ一人一人が呼び起こすことができ、一つの奇跡を与えることができます。 成功するためには、ギフトは贈与者と受取人の両方の共通の感情を反映していなければなりません。 感情が相互に関係していない場合、ギフトは歪んでおり、周囲に大混乱をもたらす可能性があります。 これが発生すると、ギフトが正しく使用されるまで、町の上の虹に黒い縞が表示されます。"
