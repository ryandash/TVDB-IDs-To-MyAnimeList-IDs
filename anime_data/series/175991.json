    "TitleEnglish": "Don Chuck Beaver",
    "SummaryEnglish": "Castor lives in the forest of Clairefontaine with his father -- his mother died when he was a baby.  He misses his mother terribly and his love for her is reflected through his looking into the sky and 'talking' to her, resulting in a vision of the deceased, usually in the moon during the night.  Family relationships are more often than not a focus of the series, through reunions, finding lost relatives and conflicts between family and friends, the latter sometimes resulting in a character running away from home.  Happily, these situations end on a positive note.",
