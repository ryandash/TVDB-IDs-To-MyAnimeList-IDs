Doctor K tempts Queen into using a vicious new attack ring she's created called 'The Shredder'. Queen uses it against Max, and nearly grinds Draciel into a pulp. But with Max using the new Draciel V2 Judy gave him, and having the will of the crowd and his teammates behind him, Max overcomes this attack, destroys Queen's Beyblade, and wins the first match of the best-of-two. Next up, is King versus Tyson, who has an improved Beyblade of his own, thanks to Kenny's ingenuity. Angered by the failure of Doctor K's attack ring, King dissolves his partnership with the scientist and vows to combat Tyson without her assistance. The resulting match is an intense, high-powered battle that's not only fair, but completely up for grabs. When Tyson's blade begins faltering for some unknown reason, the combatants spot Doctor K high above the stadium. Through a rooftop window, she's using a particle beam to try and disable Dragoon. Disgusted by her attempt to throw the match, King and Tyson put aside their differences, combine their Bit-Beasts' attack, and destroy her weapon. With the playing field even again, the Blader’s resume their match and Tyson wins. King's display of honesty generates a newfound respect for King and Queen from the Bladebreakers.",

When Lee criticizes their performance, he and Ray are challenged to an impromptu match. The jugglers beat them handily, which only exacerbates Lee's insecurity about his skills. Ray suspects that Lee's problem stems not only from a lack of sleep lately, but from a lack of communication between the two. Ray discusses the problem with Tyson, who suggests that Ray be more confrontational. Mr. Dickenson meanwhile, ponders whether to grant F Dynasty their request for a two-on-two match. Turns out it was Raul and Julia of F Dynasty who posed as the street jugglers in order to goad Lee and Ray. When the day of the match arrives, and White Tiger X faces F Dynasty, Lee and Ray discover the jugglers' true identities. Wanting payback for their earlier loss, Lee and Ray accept the two-on-two challenge and the match format is set. F Dynasty dominates the contest, causing Lee to go batty in fear of letting Ray down yet again. Coming loose at the seams, Lee's reckless blading becomes a serious concern. To save his fragile-minded teammate from further distress, Ray knocks out Lee's blade himself and accept his team's loss. Discussing the incident afterward, Lee acknowledges his mistake, and he and Ray vow to be more communicative in the future.",

He knows this will be a challenge, as F Dynasty has already used the tag-team format to defeat White Tiger X earlier in the tournament. But as the former Beyblade world champion, Tyson feels it’s his duty to prove that he’s the best, no matter what the format is. F Dynasty meanwhile, foregoes practicing in favor of another fantastic street show of their beyblading skills for a crowd of onlookers. In a flashback to their childhood, we learn that Raul and Julia have been performing as a duo since their formative years growing up in the circus. The introduction of beyblades to their act only solidified their skills. When the day of the match arrives, Tyson specifically requests the two-on-two format and F Dynasty agrees. The sand-filled Sahara dish gives Tyson and Daichi the pre-battle advantage, but during the match, Tyson’s beyblade has trouble keeping up. Coach Hiro realizes that the pressure Tyson is feeling to carry his team as the former Beyblade champion is affecting his performance. But this realization comes too late. Raul and Julia pull off another spectacular tag-team assault and defeat Tyson and Daichi. This results in an unusual predicament. All teams remaining in World Championship tournament now stand at two wins and two losses – meaning none of them have been eliminated yet.",

He decides that the only way he can become a better Blader is to start training with Max. Meanwhile Tyson discovers Daichi gone and wonders why and where his Blading partner has gone.",

Hilary isn’t allowed inside until the official public opening, and is sent away, much to her chagrin. The boys find that the BEGA building is unparalleled in the quality of its Beyblade training and facilities. Impressive as it is however, Tyson is still highly distrustful of Boris, who was responsible for trying to take over the world two years ago by using his team the Demolition Boys as soldiers. Boris tries to convince Tyson that he’s changed. Ever since his scheme was uncovered, he roamed throughout his homeland doing some soul searching. There, while watching some village children Beyblade, he had an epiphany. He realized that Beyblading is all about honor and individuality, and he made it his new goal to bring Beyblading to the masses. That’s why he took over the BBA and turned it into BEGA – as a way to give children around the world that had no exposure to the game a chance to better their lives and become champions themselves. Tyson is still skeptical, and his bad-mouthing of Boris draws the ire of a top BEGA prospect – a juggernaut named Crusher, whose Beyblade launcher is the biggest one the boys have ever seen. When grilled by Tyson about his motives for joining this professional league, Crusher admits he’s doing it for the prospect of getting rich, but only so he can afford to pay his younger sister’s hospital bills. A Beybattle ensues, and Crusher shows he’s even more powerful than he looks. Tyson is nearly defeated, but he summons his will and narrowly defeats his jumbo-sized opponent. When Boris asks Tyson if he now believes he’s sincere in his reasons for creating BEGA, Tyson still isn’t sure. But Tyson does admit that if spirited and honorable Blader’s like Crusher are in it, maybe there is some merit in the new league after all.",

Pleased with the progress of the battle and confident that Brooklyn will win, Boris watches from the sidelines with delight. Kai’s determination to win against these unbeatable odds begins to frustrate Brooklyn and he increases the intensity of his attacks. Suddenly, when it seems that Kai can’t take any more he manages to draw upon his Beyblading spirit and defeat Brooklyn. The crowd goes wild at this dramatic upset and Kai leaves the stadium only to collapse into Tyson’s arms, battered and bruised. Brooklyn remains in the stadium, stunned and confused after suffering the first defeat of his Beyblading career. Kai assures his concerned team mates that he is all right and tells Tyson that he should be more concerned with his upcoming battle against Garland. Tyson, as confident as ever, shrugs Kai’s advice off but secretly hopes he can summon the same amazing strength that his old friend showed in his battle. Kai walks unsteadily out of the stadium alone, collapses again, and then watches as Dranzer disintegrates in front of him.!",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "It’s mid-way through Tyson and Brooklyn’s final tie-breaking ‘Justice 5’ match which could give BEGA a stranglehold on the entire sport of Beyblading. Having suffered his only previous defeat at the hands of Kai, Brooklyn’s thirst for revenge takes the form of an unearthly power. Not only has his Beyblade Zeus given Brooklyn sinister black wings with which to fly, it has generated a giant vortex in the sky that is wreaking havoc on the city. Buildings are crumbling everywhere. The entire world is being enveloped by the growing darkness. Only Tyson can stop Brooklyn before it’s too late. Summoning his own formidable power from Dragoon, Tyson flies into the sky to convince Brooklyn to cease the negative emotions that are causing the havoc. When reasoning fails, the pair continues their battle above the ever-crumbling city. The tide turns in Tyson’s favor when he is able to summon the spirits of his teammates’ blades and merge them with Dragoon, which evolves into the most powerful Beyblade ever. By probing deeper into Brooklyn’s psyche, Tyson learns that his foe's anxiety stems from childhood isolation at being a genius so early in life. Tyson makes Brooklyn see that Beyblading is a pure sport to be enjoyed for one reason alone – the love of the game. Brooklyn calms down. The chaos ends. And the pair continues their match simply for enjoyment. With BEGA's HQ in shambles, the upstart league and its owner Boris are ruined. Mr. Dickenson’s BBA league restarts, but in a much more modest form. And kids everywhere – including Tyson and his friends - return to the simple, purest form of Beyblading.Then Tyson and Kai battle one last time",
