CIRS was rebuilt from the ground up and its more hidden functions were transferred to a new agency: SORD (Social Ops, Research & Development). The main purpose of SORD is to train a new generation of spies to defend the country from future threats. To achieve its ends, the organization has built many schools in the country. Mihama Academy, abandoned after its sudden closure, has become a specialized training school. So, this new Mihama Academy is home to different groups of students who every day work hard to improve their skills. These students put their own safety at risk by immersing themselves in various extrajudicial missions, all for the good of the country.",

The goal of SORD is to train a new generation of operatives to defend the country against future threats. To that end, the organization has established a series of schools up and down the country. Mihama Academy, more-or-less left to rot after its abrupt closure, has been given new purpose as one such 'specialist training school'. This new incarnation of Mihama Academy is home to a diverse group of students, who every day work to polish their unusual skills - sometimes on the job. Mihama now entrusts the misfit girls who attend it with guns and live ammunition. Paying their own safety no heed, these students are again and again plunged into dangerous extrajudicial missions - all for the good of the realm.",
