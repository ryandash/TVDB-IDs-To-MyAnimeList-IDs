Vegeta's plan to defeat Frieza involves having himself mortally wounded and then being healed by Dende - which the Saiyan prince achieves by having Krillin shoot an energy blast through his chest. Dende has no interest in healing Vegeta (who harmed so many of his people), however, and flies over to heal Piccolo instead.

Frieza eventually reaches his final form, and immediately kills Dende with an energy blast - having witnessed his healing abilities while transforming. Krillin, Gohan, and Piccolo go on the attack but the tyrant dodges every single attack they throw his way. Vegeta watches them fight from a hill, preparing to charge up to his newfound power level as Gohan finds himself on a direct collision course with another one of Frieza's blasts.",
