In the fierce fighting, Ōarai's tanks are picked off, but Leopon's team blocks off a doorway, cutting off Miho and Maho's tanks from the rest of Black Forest's forces. A tank duel ensues between them, and Miho barely emerges victorious, winning the match in the process. The Ōarai crew and their fans celebrate their victory, ending with a parade through the town.",
