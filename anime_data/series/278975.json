As Block Spider's ability is to draw attacks towards itself, having two of the same monster provides the ultimate defense, preventing Shingo from attacking. However, Shingo uses a spell card which negates his own Pendulum monsters' abilities to destroy Yuya's copy. Yuya powers up Block Spider's defense, but Shingo increases the attack of his Ultimate Darts Shooter. Just as Shingo attacks, Yuya activates a trap which not only protects himself, but also lets him regain his Pendulum Monsters, who rescue Yuzu and the others. With his cards back in his possession, Yuya performs a Pendulum Summon and, with help from his Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon and Entermate monsters, wins the duel. As Shingo tries to send his flunkies at Yuya in revenge, they are stopped by a boy named Sora Shiunin, who decides he wants to become Yuya's apprentice.",
