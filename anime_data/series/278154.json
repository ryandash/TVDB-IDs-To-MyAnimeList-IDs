Believing that his life is at risk, Nagate manages to escape the hospital where he is being treated just to be apprehended by some military cadets. One of the cadets, Shizuka Hoshijiro, accompanies Nagate while he is being questioned by the police, when a man called Ochiai appears and takes him to Captain Kobayashi, the highest authority of Sidonia, who claims that she intends to take him under her guard, with the condition of becoming one of Sidonia's Guardian pilots, to which he accepts. He is then registered as an official cadet and introduced to the others. In the occasion, Nagate learns that the Guardian pilots' main mission is to defend Sidonia against an alien hostile species known as the \"Gauna\", although the last time they encountered them was a hundred years before, and befriends Izana Shinatose, an hermaphrodite whose body can be adapted to procreate with either males or females, depending of the chosen partner. After failing to impress his peers at the pilot simulator, as the controls are different from those he trained to perfection at his former home, Nagate is called to his first sortie along Shizuka and Izana, but instead of piloting one of the recent Type 18 models, Nagate is entrusted with Tsugumori, a legendary Type 17 unit that belonged to a famous war hero, much to the anger of Norio Kunato, a cadet who always wanted to become its pilot and is being dispatched with him as well. Realizing that Tsugumori's controls are similar to those he is used to, Nagate's confidence is renewed but while performing a mining operation at a nearby asteroid with the others, a Gauna appears from inside it and attacks them.",

A funeral is held for Eiko and the high command officially announces that once again, Sidonia is at war against the Gauna.

However, just as Nagate's team retrieves the artifact, the gauna turns their attention to them and fires a blast that incapacitates all their units, except for Nagate's Tsugumori. Shizuka's unit goes out of control forcing her to bail out and instead of following his orders to tow the other two guardians back, Nagate grabs the Kabizashi and fights the gauna head on, destroying it with certain ease.

Kunato, Shizuka, En and Nagate plant their explosives around the tail of the Guana and prepare to detonate on Kunato's orders. Kunato however, activates a secure channel with Nagate and deliberately orders him to detonate the explosives too soon. This causes the Guana to become aware of their plans and the other explosives are shaken loose due to the imbalanced explosion. All frames are then ordered to temporarily fall back and re group but Nagate loses confidence and is struck by the tail. As Nagate begins to fall unconscious, the Guana almost kills him but Shizuka saves him at the expense of her own life. In the present, Nagate has recovered from his injuries but is greatly hated by the population as they believe he was the cause for many deaths during the battle (Due to the tail not being severed). Nagate takes some time away with Izana and he slowly regains his confidence in piloting Tsugumori. Meanwhile the captain orders the destruction of a Gas giant as it is believed there are Gauna present on the planet. With Yuhata assisting the captain the planet is destroyed successfully but 3 unidentified Guana appear from the planet. The Captain orders Yuhata to assemble some pilots (Including Nagate) to intercept and destroy the Guana. When more detailed images of the Guana are shown, it is revealed, to the shock of everyone, they are Gauna like replicas of the a guardian frame with tag number 702 which was the same frame Shizuka used in battle.",

Two of the Gauna are defeated, but the remaining one, later nicknamed \"Benisuzume\", retreats. After the battle, the pilots mourn five of their companions who were KIA, while Captain Kobayashi is confronted by Lala over her orders to have Nagate sortie on every mission, knowing that it may eventually lead to his death. Kobayashi then reveals that Nagate is immortal, and by not being a member of the Immortal Ship Crew that rules over Sidonia, he was seen by the other Immortals as a liability, but she claims that by having the skills of their late friend Saito, he will not die so easily. As Lala returns to the dorms, she reminisces about the events of the \"Fourth Defensive War\" 100 years ago when all citizens of Sidonia perished during a Gauna invasion, except for a few hundred survivors, including herself, Kobayashi and Saito, along Ochiai, who was responsabilized for such tragedy, but not killed because several important files were deleted from Sidonia's archives and relocated to an auxiliary database only acessible through his brain. After the incident, Saito disappeared without a trace, only reappearing 80 years later, aged because he had renounced his immortality. To preserve Saito's memory, Kobayashi ordered the creation of a clone of his, which was in fact Nagate, but Saito refused to have his mind transfered to the child, and kidnaps the infant Nagate with Lala's help, claiming that he will teach him his pilot skills nonetheless. Back to the present, the Gauna sample retrieved by Nagate is revealed to have the same appearance as Shizuka, and while in contaiment, it utters some words including Nagate's name.",

They both meet Numi Tahiro, a scientist at EBD, who wants to use Nagate in a series of tests to see how the Shizuka/Gauna hybrid would react in his presence. Nagate tries to communicate with the Gauna by mentioning Shizuka's name but it reacts violently seemingly trying to attack Nagate. Meanwhile, Kunato has relieved himself from piloting as the events during the previous battle had caused psychological distress. He then witnesses Captain Kobayashi, Dr Yure and Ochiai's clone enter an unknown area. The Captain removes unknown details from a site known as the auxiliary brain using the Ochiai clone, as only Ochiai's mind can enter the database, the clone is then put to sleep by the Captain's orders but she is unaware that Kunato was watching the events through security cameras. As time passes both Izana and Yuhata display affection towards Nagate, but Nagate spends more time with the Shizuka/Gauna hybrid as it becomes less and less hostile as Nagate consistently communicates with it. Nagate is also promoted to squad leader and leads his squad on several successful battles with the Gauna, after many battles Nagate agrees to go on a vacation with Izana to take a break. Numi Tahiro analyses what the Shizuka/Gauna hybrid is staring at, as whenever Nagate is not present the hybrid would constantly stare at one point in a wall within its confined space. It is then revealed that the hybrid is actually staring at where the kabizashis are stored, far off in another part of Sidonia, seemingly scared. In the distance Benisuzume stares intently at Sidonia and at the kabizashis storage sight.",

Meanwhile, Kunato also obtains info about Ochiai's experiments and come across a mysterious door, whose access are forbidden even to the members of his family.

Yuhata tries to maneuver Sidonia out of the way, but all efforts to avoid a collision ends in failure as the Gauna also corrects its course accordingly (With the use of its tail) to remain on a collision path. The Captain orders that all guardian frames be outfitted with the new experimental placenta piercing weaponry. 48 frames are deployed with this weaponry and a anti-planetary missile is also launched at the Gauna. Yuhata reveals the plan to the pilots stating that the 48 guardians will separate into 2 platoons. Platoon 2's objective is to destroy the tail of the Gauna (The propulsion site) and Platoon 1's objective is to destroy as much placenta as possible, so the anti-planetary missile can reach the planet at the heart of the Gauna. Nagate and Izana are both positioned in platoon 1 and when they arrive ahead of the Gauna they have exactly 2 hours before the anti-planetary missile reaches the Gauna. The plan initially goes smoothly with both platoons making short work of the Gauna's placenta. Suddenly the placenta beneath platoon 1 morphs into hyggs cannons, and begins destroying many Guardians. Platoon 2 nearly destroys the propulsion system, but Benisuzume quickly appears and destroys all 24 Guardians in platoon 2. With the entirety of platoon 2 gone and almost half the Guardians in platoon 1 destroyed, defeat seems inevitable. Yuhata quickly develops a new plan, to activate Sidonia's super hyggs particle cannon and fire it at the head of the Gauna. This would then allow the remaining pilots of platoon 1 to enter the Gauna structure and destroy the 'Master Gauna' which supposedly controls the massive hive Gauna. With no other option the Captain agrees and fires the hyggs cannon. The episode ends as the hyggs laser approaches and hits the Gauna head.",

Back to Sidonia, Nagate pays a visit to Kunato upon learning that he intends to quit being a pilot and despite not forgiving him for what happened, expresses his desire to have him by his side to defend their home and Kunato leaves him without giving an answer. After Ren thanks Nagate for attending to her request, he leaves to visit the Shizuka/Gauna hybrid again, unaware that she was moved somewhere else.",
