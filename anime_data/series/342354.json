    "TitleEnglish": "Dooly the Little Dinosaur (2009)",
    "SummaryEnglish": "Dooly is a baby dinosaur that was trapped in ice. Somehow, he survived during the Ice Ages, but ended up frozen. About 10 million years later, one of the glaciers broke off and he came to Seoul. He has super powers that he received from an extraterrestrial, but doesn't know why. He doesn't quite know how to use it deliberately but in times of danger he somehow manages to use the power. He points his right finger and yells \"Hoihoi!\" He is always biting his tongue and looks silly, but he is mischievous and loyal. Once in a while he'll resist, like when he turns Gildong into a dinosaur and sends him to the Amazon, but when he does it always turns against him.",
