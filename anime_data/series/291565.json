Just then, Twilight and Shut appear and target Haruka's family to create a Dorayaki Zetsuborg.

After a day of keeping Haruka to a hectic schedule, Aroma becomes upset when Miss Shamour fails him, saying he doesn't understand the most important thing about being a butler. Running off in tears, Aroma is saved from an oncoming vehicle by another butler named Oikawa, who shows him that what's important for a butler is to consider his master's feelings.
