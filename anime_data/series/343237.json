Wouldn't he be more helpful to the Alliance's cause by staying at Iserlohn, where the Imperial fleet is more likely to strike, making any available pilot sorely needed in the near future? However, Yang believes that this otherwise unwelcome top-down decision may actually turn out to be crucial to obtaining invaluable insight on where the struggle for power in the galaxy is heading.",

At the Supreme Operations Council, Reinhard reveals his audacious plan, not without sparking bewilderment and skepticism among the assembled admirals. Meanwhile, Heydrich Lang, former chief of the much-feared Department of Social Discipline, tries to find himself a role in the new regime, and a replacement for the Imperial throne is about to be announced.",

Here, he pays a visit to Bewcock to hand over a strictly confidential letter from Yang, which exposes his conjectures about the possible move the Imperial forces are likely to make. As Julian finally reaches Fezzan, he is immediately mesmerized by the freedom and affluence that surrounds him, and starts seriously wondering whether he will ever be apt to his new mission.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "A massive fleet led by Oskar von Reuenthal appears in the Iserlohn Corridor. Boasting overwhelming numerical superiority over the defending Alliance forces, the Imperial commander is confident he can crush his opponent in a quick and easy victory. Back on Heinessen, Bewcock warns admirals and MPs that the Empire may be following a less-obvious strategy this time, thus immediate action must be taken to avert the worst. And Yang realizes that his greatest problem of all may not be the approaching enemy ahead, but the supposed friends behind him.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "The unexpected stalemate at the Iserlohn Corridor urges the Imperial Headquarters to muster a reinforcement fleet to be immediately sent in support of Reuenthal. Or at least this is what the Imperial crews believe... but as the fleet jumps out from subspace, it becomes clear that Iserlohn is not their destination. Then Mittermeyer, commander of the fleet, announces that they are about to turn the page in the book of history. On Fezzan, people are staring overhead with anxiety as the sky is filled with ships.",
