        "eng": "In the eleventh year of the Meiji era carrying swords was forbidden by the government and those known as samurai were slowly fading away. However, there were plenty who didn't like those changes taking place in Japan and inevitably the crime rates increased. The country's only solution was an inescapable lake prison. Since the prison had no other way to access it except by water, the three boys of the Kumo family were assigned to transport the criminals to their new \"home\". Although, is that the only thing they were doing...?",
        "jpn": "笑え！ この灰色の空の下で――\r\n\r\n時は明治十一年。急速な欧米化に伴い、政府に不満を持つ人々が増え、監獄は囚人で埋まり、脱獄も後を絶たなかった。そこで政府は、滋賀県琵琶湖に重犯罪者専用の檻、日本最大・脱出不可能な湖の監獄、獄門処を設ける。その監獄への橋渡し人を請け負う曇家の三兄弟が織り成す大冒険活劇の幕が上がる……！"
