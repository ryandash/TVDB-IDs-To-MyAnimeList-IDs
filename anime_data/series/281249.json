Externally, they are indistinguishable from their fellow human beings. And worse: they live in the middle of us! Who knows, maybe the nice girl from the café or the neighbor next door has a little weakness for human flesh ?! So it's no wonder that bookworm and freshman Ken lands in the middle of a ghula's arms. Cute Rize is too great to be true: her first date with Ken even takes place in a bookstore! But when she leaves, she reveals her true nature and attacks Ken. Ken survives the ghoul attack by an incredible coincidence - but with serious injuries. He must be transplanted to his attacker's organs so that he can continue to live. At first his life goes on quite normally, but gradually he discovers some inconsistencies and develops strange cravings ...",
