    "SummaryEnglish": "Dream Hunter Rem (ドリームハンター麗夢 Dorīmu Hantā Remu?) is an anime OVA series released from 1985 to 1992.[1] Rem Ayanokōji is a \"dream hunter,\" a person capable of entering the dreams of sleeping people and fighting the demons causing nightmares.[2] The stories have their base in supernatural and standard horror, with action scenes and mystery thrown in. The first episode was originally released as a hentai OVA which contained a few pornographic scenes. Due to high popularity, the production team decided to release subsequent videos in the non-hentai anime market.[3] The first video was later re-released as \"Special Version\", removing all pornographic scenes and adding a new episode.",
