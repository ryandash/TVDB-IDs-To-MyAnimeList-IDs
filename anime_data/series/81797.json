Madam Shirley says that her prediction that Luffy will destroy Fishman Island might not happen after all since they defeated Hody and the New Fishman Pirates.\r\nMeanwhile, Shirahoshi is crying and asking the Straw Hats to not go. Usopp and Chopper complains that they are going to die in the New World. The Minister of the Left gives Nami a new New World Log Pose with three needles so they can get to the islands in the New World. The Minister of the Left explains about the new Log Pose's features when Luffy suddenly grabs onto Nami, wanting to see the new Log Pose. She complains and says that she will tell the crew where to go but Luffy complains saying that he is the captain so he should decide where they should go. Franky gets a new haircut and they start to leave but Shirahoshi comes and ask them to pinky promise to come back and the crew does it.\r\n\r\nThe Straw Hats finally leave and some of the children of the Fishman Island ask their parents if they can get a Straw Hat similar to Luffy's and Jinbe says he will get some. Luffy then remember the times when Shanks, Rayleigh, Jinbe, and Ace told him something important. The Straw Hats then comment about what they will do once they are in the New World.",
