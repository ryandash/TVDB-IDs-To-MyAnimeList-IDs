Very little is known about the girl - all we know for sure is that she lives with her equally enigmatic grandmother, that three magical straw dolls accompany and serve her, and that whenever a posting on the Jigoku Tsushin moves her, she becomes the Jigoku Shoujo.",

Men with no apparent connections to one another have been found dead, stabbed with a bamboo skewer, with their hands in the \"peace\" symbol. Eventually, the owner of a restaurant is discovered by Ichimoku Ren to be the culprit. His wife and son were killed and his daughter put into a coma when a drunk driver crashed into their house. As the news crews filmed the report of the incident, drunken men danced in the background with their hands in the \"peace\" sign. The owner had only recently decided to kill them, as he learned he has terminal lung cancer and will most likely not live to see his daughter live. Too weak to kill the last one, who has seen his face and filed a police report, he uses the Hotline to Hell. Ai reveals that the penalty of sending someone to Hell does not cover other sin, such as murder. The man is willingly taken to the hospital by the police, however in a twist, Kikuri has awakened his daughter. The price he must pay for the murders is that he will spend the rest of his life in jail, unable to be with his daughter and because of this, he breaks down.",
