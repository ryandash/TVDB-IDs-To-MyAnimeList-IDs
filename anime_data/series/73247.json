They can be put to work, perform as soldiers in the military, or mysteriously go berserk and terrorise the population.\r\n\r\nThe corporation responsible for all the major Boomer advancements is a monolithic company called GENOM. But GENOM has a rather underhanded secret agenda â€” to take over the world. With the world dependent on Boomer technology, there does not seem to be much that can stand in GENOM's way.\r\n\r\nOnly a mercenary team of four young women, the Knight Sabers, equipped with hardsuits, have the courage and the firepower to stand up to rampaging Boomers and the company behind them.",
