    "SummaryEnglish": "In the 21st century mankind was on the brink of destruction. Through genetic engineering however they eradicated such feelings as love and the desire for power. Since women are naturally less agressive than men, women to man ratio was set to 9:1. Now people are engineered to have skills that others view as being necessary. There is a giant ring that now orbits the earth, that sits there and relays information back to an alien race that sent it. Now a team of five women will try to eradicate the alien threat.",

Mika and Sofia then decide to head to the bar. There they meet two other members of their new team, Tiki and Mario Musicanova, who are brother and sister.

On the Ring, Mir, arguably the most perfect human in existence, is on a mission. She encounters some rebels who attack the Ring and barely escapes. Through the struggle, there's an explosion that does some damage",
