However, she is doubtful after observing his reaction at Tomako's. At home, Junta bemoans about his fate to Ami, his childhood friend and the only girl who doesn't make him puke. The next day, Tomako and her real boyfriend Ryuuji have a fight because Ryuuji believes their \"DNA wants them to be together.\" Junta is confronted by Karin, who forces him, at gunpoint, to go to a coffee shop with her. Once there, Karin tells hem all about her mission to stop the Mega Playboy. Seems the Mega Playboy sired 100 children, who each sired 100 kids, who each sired 100 children, and so on.
