    "SummaryEnglish": "Long, long ago, there existed a world of magic and science. God, afraid of man's potential, split the world in to the world of science, Elde, and the world of magic, Fandavale. One day in Fandavale, a terrible witch named Cendrillon (Cinderella) revives. Cendrillon plots to rule both worlds, and searches for the \"key\" which holds tremendous power. A young boy from Elde by the name of Sōta meets a mysterious girl from Fandavale, Akazukin, and her talking wolf companion, Val. Sōta learns that he is the key Cendrillon is searching for. Now it is up to Akazukin, Val, and the other Fairy Musketeers to protect Sōta from Cendrillon and her Nightmarelians who wish to obtain the power he mysteriously possesses.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Differences exist between the OVA and the television series due to length. For example, Shirayukihime (Snow White) only appears at the end of the OVA, and Ibarahime (Sleeping Beauty) only being mentioned in passing in the OVA.\r\n\r\nAnother difference is the darker feel in the OVA. The majority of the enemies in the OVA are wolves of the same race as Val, but ones who have chosen to serve Cendrillon, and have undergone transformations as a result. In addition to having hybrid forms, such as wolves crossed with spiders or bats, they seem be to undead, being little more than a wolf pelt draped over a shadow. Each has a large ring in their torso to which the edges of their pelt is attached, with nothing visible inside.\r\n\r\nThe television series, by comparison, has a much lighter feel, being made as a magical girl anime.",
