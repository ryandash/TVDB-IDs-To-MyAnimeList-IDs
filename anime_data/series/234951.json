    "SummaryEnglish": "Begin cheesy RPG backstory component. In a parallel world all is rustic and medieval styled bliss in the land of Villgust. However the stirrings of a dark and evil god brings monstrous beings into existence who begin to terrorize the land. Should he fully awaken this monstrous horde will be even more fearsome than they are now, surely causing the world to descend into endless darkness. \r\n\r\nThe goddess Windina watches with concern, and chooses to respond by selecting 8 heros of the land. Blessing them, and watching over them, she believes that they will be a powerful force and provide leadership against this encroaching evil. Although, when you look at the rather exotic bunch she picked, you've also got to figure that Windina has a rather active sense of humor. There's no doubt they're powerful, but boy are they weird.",
