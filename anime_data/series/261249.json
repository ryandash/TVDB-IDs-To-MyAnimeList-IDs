Helped by Kuro, who becomes his clansman, Shiro tricks the Colorless King to get out from Kukuri's body and trap him into his own body. Shiro teleports to where Mikoto and Reisi are and tells Mikoto to kill him while the Colorless King is still trapped in his body as only a king can slay another king. Mikoto does so, finally avenging Tatara's death but his Weismann level reaches its limit, which his Sword of Damocles is about to crash into the campus. Reisi is forced to kill Mikoto to prevent that which the latter shares some words with his fellow king before passing away peacefully. The Homra gang honors their late leader with a battle cry as they lose their powers. Neko and Kuroh escape the island, still believing Shiro is still alive.",

Kuro defeats Yukari and reaches Shiro. Meanwhile, Shiro tells Nagare that he has calculated that the power of Democles Down is enough to counter the power of the Slates and both can negate each other. He maximizes the Weismann level to the limit and brings the Democles down and effectively negates the power of the Slates. This results in Nagare's death, since he was only alive using the power of the Slates. On the other hand, since all the Democles disappear, Munakata is saved from death. Iwa arrives and asks them to escape the building, which is collapsing from explosions, but he stays back with Nagare. As everyone evacuates, the Silver King tells Kuro and Neko that he has to leave Shiro's body, since it was borrowed and he was only able to contain in it due to the power of the Slates, and that he has to return it to the original owner. In the epilogue we see that Neko has become a student in the school and the Silver King has returned into his earlier body and is a teacher in the same school.",
