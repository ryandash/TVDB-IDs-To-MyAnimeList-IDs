One of these replicants, Trixie, is attacked by a group of thugs but is rescued by Iggy, who effortlessly disarms and kills the thugs. Iggy reveals to her that he used to be a soldier on a planet called Calantha, but deserted when he realized the enemy soldiers he had been fighting and killing were also replicants.",
