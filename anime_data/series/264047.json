Checking up on Tsukushi, Tsukushi prompts both Yōto and Mai to make amends before she leaves for Italy but fails. Later, Yōto founds Tsukiko lamenting in his room as she hides inside Yōto's dakimakura but was later found out by Yōto himself. Tsukiko later leaves Yōto's room after knowing that Yōto has met Emi long before her despite her earlier claims that she was the one who knew Yōto the longest. Yōto then found passport tickets to Rome and a letter, sent by her grandparents, both belonging to Tsukiko. Meanwhile, as Yōto takes Emi for a stroll, Emi notices that something's troubling Yōto and tells him to sort it out. At the Tsutsukakushi residence, as Yōto, who disguises himself as his \"evil twin\", and Tsukushi converse of the latter's deceased parents and disapproval of going to Italy to live with their grandparents, Tsukushi intended to look for concrete evidence of her late mother and them living together through old photos, but comes out empty-handed. Tsukushi and Tsukiko then claim that they'd met Yōto in the past and then search for evidences regarding it, but only finding an unfocused picture of the sibling's late mother. While tagging along with Tsukiko, Azusa came to intervene and had a pep talk with Yōto. Afterwards, Tsukiko expresses her jealousy towards Azusa as she criticizes herself to Yōto. Claiming that meeting Yōto the longest would give her the advantage, Tsukiko wishes to see the past herself, followed by Yōto. Suddenly, a rabbit, possessed by the cat god grants their wish.",

Shortly thereafter, they meet Tsukiko's mother, Tsukasa, who is brash yet somehow soft towards the younger Yōto, who at the same time badmouths him. Through the younger Yōto, Yōto and Tsukiko were invited for dinner at Tsukasa's mansion, which is at slight disarray.
