The Fuhrer, in turn, places orders for the brothers to be captured. Mustang takes this responsibility, knowing that if they are captured by anyone else, they would surely not get the opportunity to explain themselves. Winry and Seska have gone to Rizenbul to lay low for a while after their scare at the military base. To their surprise, the mysterious stranger on the train turned out to be none other than Hoenheim, the Elric's father. They receive word of the hunt of Ed and Al, and the two go to try to help. Ed and Al, for unclear reasons, are hurrying back to their hometown, knowing that the military would surely be there, but they are not dissuaded, and trouble brews as Mustang's soldiers get closer and closer.",

They arrive in Rizenbul to find Hohenheim and Al, despite his brother''s protests, spends as much time as he can with his long lost father. The homunculus are hiding out in the church that Ryla has taken Rose to, and it becomes apparent in a fabulous plot twist, that ''him'' that the homunculus are always talking about, is in fact Ryla, who is in fact Dante. The plot thickens as Hohenheim storms their sanctuary, having heard Dante''s name from the brothers. His skill in alchemy is incredible, even enough so to scare Gluttony. Ryla faces off with him using her own alchemy, and action ensues.",

His words revealed him to the Fuhrer, who orders him to the front lines on the north, to make it easy to dispose of him when the time comes. Ed and Al are on the run, disguising themselves. They don't make it very far before being discovered, but they were far enough for Ed to find Sensei, who knows of his plans when he asks for a piece of her child's corpse. Al, trusted to stay in hiding, of course runs off and meets with Tucker. He reveals Nina's motionless body to Al, who is taken by it, and offers to use himself to help her.",

Ed learns more of Dante's past as he and Sensei mill about her old mansion and talk about their experiences with her. Sensei discovered a love letter from Hohenheim to Dante which was dated nearly 400 years ago. Ed goes back to his room to find Al gone, and Lust and Wrath waiting for him there. An unlikely alliance occurs though, as Lust's mistrust of Dante leads her to cooperate with Ed in hopes that he will make her human again. They rush off to find Al at Tucker's old research lab. They are still on their way when Sloth arrives though, and tensions are high as the episode ends showing Al''s body corroded by Tucker's transmutation.",

He reveals the pieces of his mother's corpse that he dug up in Rizenbul, stunning Sloth, and giving him a chance to seal her forever. Lust had drawn a sealing transmutation circle with her claws, so it could not be destroyed, and Ed lured Sloth into it. The deal was almost done, when Al in his infinite wisdom decided that he was going to save the homunculus, so he threw the box containing a piece of his mother out the window, thus freeing Sloth. Lust held her at bay while Ed went to get the box, but Wrath was waiting outside, and decided to absorb the box into himself so Ed couldn't get it back. More and more it became clear that the brothers would not win this battle so easily, especially with Al helping out the Homunculus. Sloth freed herself from the circle, and while Ed chased Sloth, who was now controlling Al's body from the inside, Wrath and Lust squared off. Lust is easily destroyed though, as Wrath found her locket and used it to stop her on the transmutation circle. Wrath killed Lust and headed off to find Sloth. Fortunately for the brothers, who were not in great shape at this point, Wrath was a bit inexperienced, and foolishly merged himself with Sloth. Having the box inside of him, this stopped them both and gave Ed his chance to destroy his creation, Sloth, once and for all.",
