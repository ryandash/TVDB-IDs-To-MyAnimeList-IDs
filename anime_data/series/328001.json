However, Rohmonov denies Mahmut, as getting involved in politics goes against the merchant law. At the market, Mahmut and co. see Niki Al-Bahram, a young girl whose merchant father recently passed away and has inherited his trading license, being dismissed by her father's former workers and business partners. Mahmut and co. offer to help Niki, though he warns her of the dangers that his plans will incite and that she will be breaking the Argyros's merchant laws. Niki accepts Mahmut's offer and starts her new caravan by selling highly prized Türkiye jewels, though Mahmut and his group disguised themselves as women to hide from Rohmonov. Still wanting to start eastern trade relations, Mahmut has Niki set up a meeting with Wan Yixin, a native from the eastern country of Çinili and someone with close ties to the emperor. After Mahmut convinces Wan that a business transaction that will bring peace to Çinili, Wan agrees to order an enormous shipment of Venedik glass, which made Venedik purchase all the wheat from Tharros to use as box padding. As the wheat was meant to be provisions for Balt-Rhein's invasion campaign against Türkiye, Louis orders the naval fleet stationed at Phoiníkē to intercept the shipments. This resulted in a naval battle between Venedik and the empire, who lost the fight and are imprisoned. Mahmut is pleased that he was able to pit Venedik and Balt-Rhein against each other, earning Venedik as an ally for Türkiye and stalling Balt-Rhein's invasion plans against his homeland.",

Meanwhile, Mahmut, Abiriga, Kyros, and Niki travel to the northern country of Urado, a strict isolationist nation that shares a border with Balt-Rhien and Greater Türkiye. They meet Cabinet Minister of Türkiye Negotiations, Princess Margit, and her father, King Zsigmond III. As Margit gives them a tour, Mahmut and co. learn that Urado is a poverty-stricken state and how the citizens are struggling to survive. Later, Abiriga deduces that the foul smell emanating from the coastline cliffs is fossilized bird feces, which produces high quality fertilizer. Mahmut determines that the fertilizer will help revitalize Urado. Late at night, Mahmut and co. are summoned by Zsigmond, Margit, and Princess Gertrud to the meeting hall, alongside an ambassador from Balt-Rhein. Zsigmond declares that Urado will enter a treaty with the empire, giving them passage to their territory in exchange for goods. Sensing Zsigmond's reluctance, Mahmut explains that the fertilizer from the coastlines will help revive Urado and that if they ally with Türkiye, they will help Urado trade with eastern countries. After Mahmut points out that the empire's cruel treatment of nations they annexed and how they will force Urado to go to war, Zsigmond chooses to ally with Türkiye and orders the Imperial envoy to be executed as a shown of trust.",

Brega speaks with L'isonlani's Doge Doria, who falsely promises to honor the pact, but has secretly sided with the empire. When claims of a plague spread around the Centro, Brega's crew are forced to quarantine themselves for forty days. In the meantime, Doge Lucio suspects this is a ploy and L'isonlani has sided with the empire.

With possession of Scolgio and Phoiníkē, General Pineau declares that Balt-Rhein is now the \"heir\" of the former Phoiníkē Empire and that they seek to conquer all its former territory.
