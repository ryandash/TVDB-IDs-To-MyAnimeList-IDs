He explains how the Orichalcos appeared and corrupted the hearts of the humans and turned people into monsters, including his own wife, Iona. Dartz was shown the truth, however, when he encountered an Orichalcos stone and it explained everything to him and gave him the power of the Great Leviathan. His father, Ironheart, and daughter, Chris, tried to stop him by gaining the help of the monsters from the Dominion of the Beasts, but neither side was victorious. Dartz wants to finish the battle he began 10,000 years ago, and explains that due to his Orichalcos Kyutora's ability, his Life Points are safe from Yami Yugi and Kaiba's last attack. He then plays Orichalcos Deuteros, the second level of the Seal. As the duel progresses, things look dim for Yami Yugi and Kaiba, especially when Dartz plays his Mirror Knight Calling card which summons four Mirror Knights to the field.

In addition, to make things worse, Yugi has to put half his deck in the graveyard to keep it going, much to his distaste. Add to the fact that so long as the card does remain active, Kaiba's computer mainframe will be infected with an unstoppable virus, and you have a recipe for the ultimate disaster. Even Leon isn't happy with the arrangement, especially since it's cheating. However, Leon's pleas fall on Zigfried's deaf ears as he controls the duel from the balcony. However, Yugi promises that he'll help Leon destroy the castle somehow. But how can he destroy a card that can't be affected by traps and spells?",

Then he used a magic card that sacrificed all three monsters in order to summon Royal Card Knight. By discarding a monster, each of the first five levels, the knight can destroy every card on the field, but when the smoke clears it turns out the castle is also immune to monster special abilities as well. But then Yugi points out that because he only has one card in his deck, he can't discard half of his deck to keep the castle on the field, therefore, the castle is ruined. Leon doesn’t want to finish because he felt liked he cheated but Yugi convinces him to continue, and with one card left, Yugi summons Dark Magician and uses Diffusion Wave Motion to destroy all of Leon’s monsters and wipe out his life points. Yugi won the tournament and he hoped to see Leon again so they can duel fair. Afterwards, Yugi and his friends left by private plane to go back home where Yugi hopes to finally recover the pharaoh’s memories.",
