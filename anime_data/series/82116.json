Joseph and Xargin engage each other in Blassreiter forms with Gerd and Hermann assisting the former by using their powers on his body. Sasha dies when her Bow Rider explodes from overheating while Meifong is killed after engaging a spacecraft over the Earth. Joseph, after the Isis pill is used, dies with its particles killing Xargin and his Demoniacs by making them solid for good. 5 years after the events of Blassreiter, Germany was able to rebuild from scratch and the federal government reformed XAT with Amanda as a leading officer. The reformed XAT was given a new mandate to protect people who have the ability to turn to Blassreiters. Malek is indoctrinated into XAT due to his abilities as a XAT special agent.",
