    "SummaryEnglish": "As far as adventuring goes, supporting your party is a thankless job—even more so if you’re just a lowly red mage like Yuke Feldio. So, when he gets fed up with his A-rank party of total a-holes, he ditches them for some former students—a trio of girls who just looove his company. Thing is, to conquer the world’s greatest dungeon and achieve his dream, he’ll have to teach these cuties a thing or two…and he may just learn there’s more potential within him (and them) then he ever knew.",
