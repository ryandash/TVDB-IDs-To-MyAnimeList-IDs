The two transofrm into Iron Wolf and Iron Tiger and are able to defeat Swordfish and cause him to withdraw. Afterwards they confront Dragon and tell him he can't see beyond his own world. They won't openly work against the Earth from here on out, but they will side only with the winner. Gladis returns and vows to Cerberus to come up with a plan to deal with Victor and Gregory, but Cerberus informs him not to fret because he has things in control. Cerberus has placed Klude on house arrest, removed Drossas and Vyse from power, and removed Klude's bone from him. When Victor and Gregory learn of this development, they volunteer to go find out more details for Liebert. Luke calls his father to tell him about Higashio's development only to learn all the higher-ups knew about it. Higashio talks to Shougo to learn about the enemies change after talking to Shougo. Semiria (Dark Hawk), Ulurra (Dark Owl), and Swordfish then arrive to attack. They form a line and summon the Majin of Water, causing our heroes to form a line and summon the Majin of Fire. Dragon and Swordfish attack each other in their powered up states while Jaguar and Shark do battle with Hawk and Rhino and Leo do battle with Owl. The trio is shocked when our heroes do damage to all of them and force them to withdraw. The episode ends with Shoujo at a teacher-parent conference. It is revealed that his wishy-washy attitude is a big weakness but that his ability to think things through is becoming a huge strength. Shougo then begins to realize he too has changed since meeting the others. Shougo is then confronted by Liebert, but the two are in for a surprise when Higashio stops for one final visit. He didn't come solely for Victor and Gregory. He was hoping to meet someone from Nepos Angelis.",
