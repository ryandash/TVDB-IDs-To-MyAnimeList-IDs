                    "SummaryEnglish": "On his way home from school, Aono unexpectedly bumps into Takimoto, who is crying alone in pain. As Aono shows concern for his senior, Takimoto slowly begins to speak. He talks about the events surrounding the club member who quit, and his own cold feelings and confusion after no longer finding meaning in club activities. These feelings overlap with Aono's, who once gave up the violin due to his relationship with his father. Aono talks about the pain he felt when he stopped playing, and how his feelings toward his father are different now than they were back then. Aono's words make Takimoto decide.",
