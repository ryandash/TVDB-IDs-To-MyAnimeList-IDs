    "SummaryEnglish": "A cat accidentally brought the newly graduated university student Wei Ran to a world he had no idea existed. He discovered that the only train that could take him back to the human world only passed once every six months. While trying to find a way back home, all he could do was temporarily move in with YaYa, the cat who owned \"Whimsical Wish\". Wei Ran unexpectedly found that dragon scales always appeared wherever he went, just when things seemed to be stabilizing. And every time the dragon scale materialized, it had a completely unique and strange effect.",
