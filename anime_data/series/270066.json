                    "SummaryEnglish": "Intelligent, young noble William Twining maintains his spot as the top student of his school before the holidays start. When the principal tells him that the tuition hasn't been paid, William goes home to ask his uncle, only to discover that they had gone bankrupt. In order to find a way to pay for tuition, William breaks down the door to the secret family treasury, cutting himself in the process. His blood drips onto a drawing on the ground and a man appears, calling himself Dantalion, Grand Duke of Hell, and tells William to elect him to be king of Hell. Being a realist, William refuses to believe Dantalion's words about demons and has him dragged away by the police. Curious, William goes back to the treasury to find Dantalion's \"trick\", only to be sucked away into Dantalion's mansion. He meets Baphomet, the goat butler, who explains the election for interim king and he tries to sort things out. Suddenly, the mansion crumbles after another demon, Gilles de Rais, attacks to kill Dantalion. Since Dantalion was still trying to get back to Hell, Gilles decides to take William instead, but is stopped once Dantalion arrives. The two fight ferociously, their power slowly destroying the warp space between the human world and Hell. William, not wanting to be stuck in Hell, orders Dantalion to stop, and Dantalion unwillingly does. Having learned of William's status as the \"Elector\", Gilles leaves to report back to his master. Dantalion grabs William and calls him Solomon and asks if he has really forgotten him, but William stays silent. Later, William returns to the human world and to school, where he learns that his tuition was paid by an anonymous donator. Wondering whom the mysterious donator is, William sits in class when Dantalion comes in and introduces himself as a new student.",

Meanwhile, Dantalion reveals to William that he was the one paid for his tuition and that he will stay until he is chosen for the throne. William refuses to be indebted to him and asks a friend and fellow perfect, Mycroft Swallow, to give him scholarship forms so he can pay for his tuition on his own. Dantalion becomes popular with the jocks at school, but later leaves to attend business in Hell. Using Isaac, Sytry approaches William as an underclassman and proposes that his uncle could be his \"patron\" after William meets him. Desperate to get rid of Sytry, Isaac tries to summon an angel to defeat the former, but summons a demon boar that chases after him and William instead. Sytry kills it and reveals his true nature as the viscount and twelfth noble of Hell and one of Lucifer's candidates to a uncaring William. To force William's hand, Sytry captures Isaac, who is then saved by Dantalion. The two demons engage in a battle until William forces them to stop, who then declares that he will not elect anyone for the throne before leaving. While Isaac takes delight in William's status as the Elector and a descendant of Solomon, Sytry informs William that he will be staying at the school, a fact that he reluctantly accepts. At William's manor, Kevin opens a box containing the ring that once belonged to Solomon that given was to him by God.",

Later on, William orders Dantalion to stay away from him, but is then warned by the latter that his orders will only work on Solomon's seventy-two pillars and that more demons will come after him. In addition, Dantalion asks why William cannot remember him in his past life, angering him. At night, William, Isaac, and Sytry heads into the woods to investigate a rumor of a ghost haunting their dormitory. They discovered that it is actually a low-leveled demon under the command of Crosby, who lures them to the church to weaken Sytry's powers in order to kill him.

While William decides to no longer deny the existence of demons, Crosby escapes to relay William's status to his organization, the Hand of God.

Shortly after, William barges into her room when he heard a crash and finds a magic circle drawn onto the floor. During the boat race, Nathan exposes his identity as a demon to Dantalion and William when he uses his power to save Maria from a broken oar flying in her direction. At night, Sytry informs William that Maria opened a portal from Hell in order to summon a demon to form a contract with it. The demon attempts to attack Maria, but she is then saved by Nathan in his demon form. Dantalion arrives and explains that Nathan's true name is Camio, a half-demon born from a human woman, one of Solomon's pillars, and a candidate for Lucifer's throne. Maria and Camio reminisce over their past and her desire to become a demon when she dies from her lung disease. Dantalion advises Camio to let Maria die as a human rather than becoming a Nephilim, and they both agree. On Maria's suggestion, Camio decides to remain in the school so he will not be alone once she is gone. Before Maria retires from Stradford to enter treatment for her illness, the three boys that broke into her room comes by and apologizes for stealing an old photo of her and Camio.",

Sent by her mother Astaroth, Lamia appears at Stradford and drags William into Hell through a portal and delivers him to a meeting composed of Sytry, Camio, the Four Kings, and other aristocratic demons. The demons explain the situation to William, who disregards it as the war between Heaven and Hell means nothing to him. Due to William's dismissive attitude on the election for interim king and Hell in general, a demon tries to attack William out of rage, but Dantalion appears and defends him. Solomon's Ring of Wisdom, which William still has in his possession, falls out of his clothes and the demons recognize it as the ring that Solomon used to enslave them. Determined to put an end to Solomon's control over the demons and gain power, Baalberith and his minions moves in to kill William, who slips the ring onto his finger, causing Solomon's soul to take over his body. While Michael and Kevin sense this from Heaven, Solomon easily fends off the demons, including Gilles de Rais (who wanted to kill him to raise his status), and uses his power blessed by God to nearly eradicate Hell. As Solomon greets each of his former demon friends and pillars, Dantalion, realizing that Solomon's tremendous power is intimidating the demons and would destroy Hell, goes to remove the ring to no avail. Shockingly, Dantalion is the only one Solomon does not recognize and the latter inquires on the former's identity.",

Despite being powerful, Solomon did not raise arms against his father and lived most of his life peacefully with his demon companions, much to Dantalion's bewilderment. After crushing his father's army that was sent to kill him, Solomon took over the kingdom of Israel. Although Solomon showed his father mercy, David refused to acknowledge him as his son and cursed him, much to Solomon's sadness. Soon after, Solomon requested to die by Dantalion's hands. Regaining consciousness, Dantalion saves Baalberith from being destroyed by Solomon and urges William to remember who he is to break Solomon's control over his body.
