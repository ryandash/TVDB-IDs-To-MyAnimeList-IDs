The new patient turns out to be Rika, a seventeen-year-old girl in the eastern ward who enjoys reading the works of Ryūnosuke Akutagawa. At first, Yūichi, with the assistance of Akiko, lies about reading the same book, but Rika easily sees through this act and demands that in exchange for her forgiveness, he must do what she wants. One day, Rika requests to go up to Mount Hōdai despite her weak, sickly condition because it was the same place her father hiked up before he died, and she believed if she is able to do the same, she will lose her fear of dying. Yūichi sneaks her out of the hospital with much success and realizes that he is doing favors not because she tells him to, and when he tries to tell her his true intent of assisting her, he faints.",

When Yūichi recovers, Akiko creates an opportunity for him to apologize. However, while waiting, he encounters Dr. Natsume and learns that he had been treating Rika for six years and only transferred to the hospital to keep watch of her. Dr. Natsume is surprised that Rika had told Yūichi about her illness since she had never done so in the past, nor had she ever made a friend. He gives Yūichi a pornographic magazine, and Rika catches him perusing through the magazine and again locks him outside; meanwhile, Akiko realizes that Dr. Natsume had purposely caused this because he found it \"entertaining\". Eventually, Rika and Yūichi get back on friendlier terms, but Yūichi becomes offended when Rika states that the only reason she wanted to apologize was because of Dr. Natsume's influence. In response, he harshly expresses his contempt of the doctor, and Rika throws her book at him.

Before Rika's operation, she tells him that Yūichi is able to read Les Thibault. While patiently waiting for her operation to be over, Akiko tells Yūichi that the reason why Rika brought up the idea of photos was because Akiko had showed her a photo of Yūichi. Rika had it taped to her leg as a luck charm. Eventually, Yūichi reads Les Thibault, and ultimately discovers a parallel from the ending of the book—it is Rika's confession of love to him.
