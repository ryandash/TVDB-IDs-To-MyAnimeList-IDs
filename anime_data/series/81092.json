But he is a genius, and can save almost any of his patients` life (as long as they have the money for it, that is), and is known to many around the world, especially to those of medicine and science. He`s a man of science himself, and does not believe much until he has seen it, yet it is many times he is surprised by love and nature often overpowering the science he bases his life in.",
