    "SummaryEnglish": "Twenty years from now, in early summer at Amizawa Village...\r\n\r\n18-year-old Ebihara Chinami emits electrical waves when she becomes distressed. Due to this, she cannot use electronics such as PCs and cellphones very well. Her power is so strong that it nearly crashed the plane her family was on by causing instrument malfunctions.\r\n\r\nHer power leads her to transfer schools frequently. As usual, on the first day of school, Chinami is a little nervous, causing her classmates` cellphones to glitch and electronics to react to her.\r\n\r\nThe more nervous she becomes, the worse the situation gets, so she begins to take notes on where and how badly the electronics react to her.\r\nShe eventually meets Kotaro from the science club, who is interested in experimenting on her; Yumi, a classmate and shrine maiden with the same power as she; and Sonomi. They refer to the power as \"TYPE-E.\"\r\n\r\nWhat they don`t know is that a secret organization is after Chinami`s power.\r\n\r\nThere will be a moment when many lives will be saved by Chinami’s power. However, at the same time, someone will be watching her...",
