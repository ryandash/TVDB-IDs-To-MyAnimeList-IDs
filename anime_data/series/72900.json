Later that night, Aruto finds that the mirage is more trouble to maintain than it is worth; if the half-asleep Kokoro wandering in on her looking for the toilet and the fast approaching deadline is not enough, her editor Sarara Saeki has set up an author's interview with Kokoro and plans to pick up the manuscript of the novel.

While Akaha and Kokoro speculate that the Mayor is inviting them to a party, Aruto and Iina suspect that it is for a far more sinister reason but support Kokoro's decision to welcome Marie with a sign the next morning only to find that Marie has a hostile political volition. Iina is surprisingly pragmatic about the whole situation later that evening as she defeats Kokoro's advertising proposal by stating the logistical obstacles of arriving at Kokoro Library. Iina and Aruto do not have to observe their sibling for very long to realize that Kokoro's anguish would eventually get the better of her. Aruto offering to write more novels as an income engine for the library becomes the preamble for Iina to again exhibit her insight regarding the big picture. Kokoro overhears her sisters' divergent concourse and races off to locate her father's diary that she hopes will save the Library.",
