Nona investigates how Sumomo was able to use the freezing spell in their last duel and reads book after book. She discovers that the last genius (and the only one of her time) who was able to use the spell was Karin-sama- who happens to be the one whom Nona's admired since she was a child. Karin was a legendary Steller Spinner, the 'youngest ever genius girl who surpassed everyone. 18 years before this story, he came to Retoroushe to collect the stardrops, but she never returned. Masaharu wants to see Sumomo again to find out her feeling for him in person. Their teacher, Natsume-sensei, is revealed to be Sumomo's uncle. Nona talks to Natsume-sensei and she finds out Karin-sama is Sumomo's mother, But Sumomo doesn't know her mother was a Stellar Spinner. Sumomo takes a walk with her father and, after a talk, she decides to go back to school, saying she has something she has to do. She sends a message to Masaharu, saying to meet them in 'their special place.' He has his phone off though, thus he receives it 2 hours late. He rushes off to the garden where she's waiting. He confesses again and waits for her reply. She says that she loves him too and they plant a lost bulb together.",

She challenged Sumomo to a duel to capture stardrops (she has released hers) when Sumomo, Masaharu and Nadeshiko came to visit her.

Nights before the full moon, Sumomo practiced using the recipe on some plants on the greenhouse, with Nadeshiko accompanying her. Meanwhile, Nona practiced cooking as a kind of help for Sumomo. Exhaustion soon struck Sumomo, and she collapsed on the room where Kisaragi-sensei has been keeping Masaharu. After dreaming some flashbacks, she found and ate the bento box made for her by Nona. Later on the school grounds, she performed the recipe to change Masaharu back, but went almost out of control even after being amplified by Kisaragi-sensei.
