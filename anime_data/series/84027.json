Sumomo greeted Masaharu, calling him by his first name (to the shock of their friends). Their friends then pestered him into also calling Sumomo by her first name.

Nadeshiko confronted her and told her that it wasn't her fault, reassuring her that Sumomo never blamed her for anything. In search for a solution, Kisaragi-sensei discovered a recipe that could help them. But the recipe was found to be very difficult to use, so they decided to perform it on a full moon (when, as Kisaragi-sensei mentioned, Figurare's powers could be used to its fullest). Nights before the full moon, Sumomo practiced using the recipe on some plants on the greenhouse, with Nadeshiko accompanying her. Meanwhile, Nona practiced cooking as a kind of help for Sumomo. Exhaustion soon struck Sumomo, and she collapsed on the room where Kisaragi-sensei has been keeping Masaharu. After dreaming some flashbacks, she found and ate the bento box made for her by Nona. Later on the school grounds, she performed the recipe to change Masaharu back, but went almost out of control even after being amplified by Kisaragi-sensei. Luckily, Nona (as well as another surprise character) came to her aid, and they were able to bring back Masaharu.",

Sumomo, however, decides not to use the medicine, and clings to the promise she and Masaharu had made.
