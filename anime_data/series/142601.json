Audrey Burns seeks to meet Vist first and convince him not to turn over LaPlace's Box, believing the Sleeves will use it to start another war. Meanwhile, a battle breaks out between the Federation's Londo Bell task force and the Sleeves. As the collateral damage rises, the colony is evacuated.

Before his death, Vist entrusts the Gundam to Banagher, who realizes that Vist was his father. Banagher then launches in the Unicorn Gundam and confronts the Sleeves' elite pilot Marida Cruz, who is piloting the Kshatriya.",
