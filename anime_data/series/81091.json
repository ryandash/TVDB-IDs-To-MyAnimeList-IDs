As he arranges different marked glasses on the counter, he pours in water into each of them and places a drop from each of the different bottles in the glasses. He is to turn facing away from the counter as the man randomly switches the positions of the glasses for him to guess the names of the drinks. As this continues, the episode switches to a flashback scene where it appears that the man on the counter turned out to be a con man after his wish to perform a fake proposal to the woman in the bar is declined by Ryuu, whom detected his error playing as a doctor during their early conversations. The man went as far as adding a different cocktail into one of the glasses during the taste test. Ryuu however, successfully detects his trick and accurately guessed the mixture of which the drink contained. The featured drink is \"Pastis Water\".",

Sensing Miwa's doubt that Ryuu could ever make a mistake in fixing a drink, the vendor proceeds to tell the story of Ryuu's early days as an apprentice bartender at Bar Saito through an extended flashback. An important looking businessman named Ryuuichi Minegishi arrives at Bar Saito with an attractive, younger date, Kanako. Minegishi seems to know the bar's master, Ryuu's senior bartender, quite well and gives Ryuu his business card which indicates that he is a CEO of his own company. Kanako orders a champagne cocktail and Ryuu serves her Champagne Pick-Me-Up in a tall flute glass. Kanako looks displeased and returns it, puzzling Ryuu as to what he did wrong.",

He claims to follow a star up until she enters Eden Hall. He later gets into an argument with Ryuu after declining his recommendation of having a champagne, and downing a cup of Guinness beer instead. Afterwards, Ryuu offers Okita the Black Velvet, which is a mixture of both beer and champagne. He doubted Ryuu and boastfully predicts that the drink will spill out of the glass, generally basing off the idea from his years of thorough research and study of fluid mechanics. This is not the case however, as Ryuu successfully pours both the beer and champagne simultaneously, without the mixture pouring out of the cup. It is noted in this episode that Ryuu is amongst the very few bartenders in Japan who are able to mix the Black Velvet perfectly without pouring them separately. Thus, the featured drink of episode 10 is the Black Velvet.",

The main narrator of the series makes an appearance in this episode and visits Eden Hall and sat down by the counter to have a talk with Ryuu, although the rest of the episode is told from Ryuu and both his senior bartenders' perspective. Ryuu mentions that he feels fortunate to be able to live through his job, choosing not the craft of bartending, rather the life of a bartender. Therefore, the final featured drink is \"Bartender\".",
