The base is destroyed, and Big Convoy walks away victorious.\r\nAfterwards, Big Convoy is flying solo when he receives a communique ordering him to report to Cybertron Camp - a space station that provides supplies for Cybertrons engaged in space operations. He turns off the transmission at first, but then the base appears right in front of him!

He orders everyone to take their stations and the Gung Ho warps towards planet Solid.\r\nUnknown to the Cybertrons, the Destrons are following them. All the Destrons are eager to get the Amogolois capsule except one. Dead End does not like the idea of sneaking around, to him it is behavior unbecoming a warrior.
