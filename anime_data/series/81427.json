Rikka starts crying again as Amu gets angry and yells at Rikka, knocking some senses into her. She transformes with Diamond and heads towards the rest of the guardians. Amu uses Twinkle Hold but it failed. Rikka approaches the X Eggs only to have them back away. One egg is close to cracking but Rikka leaps towards the egg, stopping it from breaking. She promises to the other eggs that she would not make them feel lonely anymore. This triggers her transformation with Hotaru into Pure Feeling. Together, Amu and Rikka purify the eggs using Open Heart, and the eggs thank Rikka for the good times they had and that she listened to them, before returning to their owners again. After that, Amu goes home only to find that Ikuto is hiding under the blankets of her bed.",
