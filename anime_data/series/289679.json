After explaining his situation to Kumagami and joining up with his allies, Shunsuke began trying to think of a way to keep them safe from the facility. As Shunsuke time-leaped multiple times in order to find an answer, his vision growing weaker with each leap, he eventually came upon the idea to found a school specifically for ability users. Following his final leap, which left him blind and thus unable to use his ability further, Shunsuke managed to buy out an educational facility before arranging for Yuu and Ayumi to have their memories of him erased so he can work behind the scenes. After Shunsuke finishes explanation, Yuu loots his time-leap ability and returns to the day before Ayumi died. Informing Nao of the situation, Yuu takes Ayumi's collapse ability away from her, before she and Nao use their abilities scare off Konishi so she can't bring harm to Ayumi. With Ayumi finally safe, she and Yuu regroup with Kumagami, who takes them to see Shunsuke.",

Later, Kumagami's aide Furuki is threatened into handing him over to a terrorist group, who force him into telling them everything he knows about ability users. Using this information, the terrorists kidnap Nao and hold her, Kumagami, and Furuki's family hostage in exchange for Yuu. Learning of this, Yuu goes to rescue them. Upon meeting up with the terrorists and ensuring the safety of Furuki's family, Yuu is attacked by another ability user, who slashes his eye, preventing him from time traveling. The pain of the wound triggers his collapse ability, which destroys the building. Although Yuu uses his telekinesis to protect himself and the other ability user, Kumagami is impaled after protecting Nao from the wreckage and dies as a result, devastating Shunsuke.",

She gets this opportunity when Yusa hosts a food report on their parents' restaurant, allowing Misa to express her appreciation to them, which in turn gives Yuu a better appreciation of Ayumi's cooking. Later, as Yuu becomes determined to help Shunsuke, who is still in turmoil over Kumagami's death, Nao suggests that he could protect all of the ability users around the world by simply stealing their abilities. Despite the risk of taking on so many powers, Yuu accepts and then confesses his feelings to Nao, who tells him she will be waiting until he succeeds, before taking her ability. After informing Shunsuke of his mission, Yuu prepares to go overseas to find someone with a power similar to Kumagami's to track down other ability users. He takes the abilities of Jōjirō, Yusa, and Misa, the latter of whom leaves behind a letter for Yusa expressing how much fun she had.

As his journey continues across many other countries, the burden of taking on so many abilities start to take their toll on Yuu as he struggles to keep them under control, soon becoming afraid of what he might do unconsciously while sleeping.
