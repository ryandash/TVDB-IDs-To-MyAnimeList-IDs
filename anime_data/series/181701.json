    "SummaryEnglish": "The year is 220X. Technology has advanced rapidly since the age of the internet, leading to the creation of new and more efficient modes of transportation, as well as the construction of futuristic cities, all linked together by three satellites orbiting the Earth—Pegasus, Leo, and Dragon. The satellites accomplish this by maintaining a network of EM waves around the planet's atmosphere, thereby powering the invisible EM Wave World. The human population carries portable devices called Transers to interface with the EM Wave World and other electronic devices. Problems caused by criminals and EM Wave Viruses manipulating the EM Wave World are commonly dealt with by the Satella Police.",

            "SummaryEnglish": "A proud warrior of the FM Planet, Omega-Xis, betrays his kind and escapes to Earth where he makes contact with Geo Stelar. Like his fellow extraterrestrials called FM-ians, Omega-Xis is capable of initiating a process known as \"Electromagnetic Wave Change,\" which transforms ordinary humans of the same frequency as themselves into \"EM Wave Humans,\" allowing them to freely operate in the EM Wave World. With these new powers, Geo becomes known as Mega Man, a hero of Echo Ridge.",

To make matters worse, Burai soon appears and knocks Rockman unconscious. Within Subaru's psyche, he encounters the sword thrust into the ground. In an allusion to The Sword in the Stone, Subaru is able to pull the sword from the ground, awaken, and take control the Thunder Berserk form to defeat Burai. Meanwhile, Phantom Black finds that, unfortunately, the pyramid holds no treasure.",
