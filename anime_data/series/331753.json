    "SummaryEnglish": "Asta and Yuno were abandoned together as babies in baskets in the same church the same day, and since then they have been inseparable. When they were children, they promised that they would compete with each other to see who would become the next Wizard King. However, as they grew, some differences between them became clear: Yuno was a magical prodigy, while Asta could not use magic at all. In a country where magic is everything and athletic ability is nothing, Asta tried every day to provoke even the simplest magic of himself with physical training and strong proclamations of his will",

To snap them all out of their odd behaviour Yami orders them to participate in a team bath. While in the bath Yami reminisces about his past when he first joined the Grey Deer squad, now known as the Aqua Deer squad, with the Wizard King as his squad captain. He was hired by villagers to protect their harvest from bandits in exchange for food since the villagers had no money. Yami agreed but while fighting the bandits was overwhelmed by their numbers, until he received help from Captain Vangeance, who at that time was only another member of the Grey Deer’s, not yet a captain. Together they captured all the bandits except the leader who escaped. Before going their separate ways Yami and Vangeance decided to become rivals and see who would become a Squad Captain first, and their rivalry continued for many years afterward.",

The bandits attacked Yami’s village and Yami found himself facing the bandit leader who escaped years ago, now armed with a powerful magic staff. Yami defeated him regardless but was trapped by two traitorous magic knights, Goht of the Crimson Lions and Mohl of the Silver Eagles. They attempted to kill Yami to cover up their crimes but Yami was rescued by Vangeance and they defeated the traitors. The Wizard King promoted Yami and Vangeance to Squad Captains. Yami decided to only accept hooligans and outcasts and formed the Black Bulls while Yami formed the Golden Dawn and only accepted strong nobles. Asta fails to see the point of Yami’s story, to never quit no matter how many times Yuno beats him, and is punished for being an idiot. Asta regains his former spirit and joins the other Bulls waiting for the exam results, only for the sudden and violent arrival of Mereoleona of the Crimson Lions.",
