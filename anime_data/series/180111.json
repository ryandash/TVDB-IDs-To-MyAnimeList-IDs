The only job he had was one with a company which eventually went out of business. One day, a mysterious fortune teller called him and told him that he is definitely surrounded by bad luck. The fortune teller then gave him a cell phone, and then said that perhaps Mutsumi's luck will improve. The magical cell phone awakens all of his pets that he owned when he was a little kid, one by one, in the form of beautiful young girls.",
