After they saw the past, Chocolat realized that Pierre was just an ordinary magical kid like Vanilla and that he too have two hearts. When she told Pierre about it, he did not believe her and flew away. By then the dog returned and led Chocolat and her friends to the silver berry which was trap in a cage of ice.
