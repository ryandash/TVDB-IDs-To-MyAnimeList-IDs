We then have it demonstrated that it is normal for Mikako's mother Ruriko to frequently behave as a dependent elder sister rather than as a mother a session of nocturnal manga synthesis. The apartment manager Noriji Sunami often likes to tease Mikako and Tsutomu prior to their school commute; once at Yazawa Geijyutsu Gakuen, Mikako's friends Risa Kanzaki and Mai \"P-chan\" Oota teasing Mikako becomes the forum for demonstrating that Sensei Hamada has no qualms about detaining Mikako after school for clumsy handiwork. Tsutomu's friends Yuusuke Tashiro and Jiro Nishino are excited about a euphoric diurnal engagement of karaoke with Mariko \"Body-ko\" Nakasu; frightened for the oblivious Tsutomu when Mariko disposes him, Mikako races off toward Hiroaki Tokumori's bar after imparting her stamp of approval. Hiroaki ultimately mediates the lover's quarrel and warns Tsutomu to focus more for quality rather than quantity after Mikako heads home only to be forced into a rainy-day layover with a stray cat during which she reminisces about her collaborative prologue with Tsutomu who comes to her rescue and escorts her home.",

A pair of star-struck schoolgirls accosting Tsutomu with a love letter during the commute to school and Risa's remarks about the convergent cerebral chemistry demonstrated in the situation along with P-chan's exhortation of an author's signature to a sentimental manga sets Mikako to wondering what infatuation is like; while Tsutomu reads the love letter from the schoolgirls, Yuusuke emphasizes the upcoming diurnal karaoke engagement that he and Jiro want to take place after school that day. Unable to accept that her anguish is because she loves him, Mikako does not respond well to Tsutomu suddenly aborting the shopping trip even though Tsutomu later tries to check in with her. Yuusuke and Jiro's subterfuge backfires on them when Tsutomu becomes the center of attention for the girls and becomes Mariko's infatuation; the ultimate irony is that it is Mikako's vindictive rejection of his apology and the adversarial divergent concourse that it ignites the next morning that inspires Tsutomu to unequivocally return Mariko's sentiments.",

The next morning finds that neither Ruriko nor Mikako has slept very much...and that Tsutomu has done some shopping for Kuro—the payload thereof delivered the day before. Deprived of ethical legitimacy, Mikako heads over to Tsutomu's place and acknowledges her fallibility. Tsutomu acknowledging his culpability gives way to accompanying Mikako in acquiring more pet supplies...that is, if Mariko had not exhorted Tsutomu's presence at her place at her convenience. While Mikako fumes at Tsutomu's »snub« and tries to wrap her mind around Tsutomu dating Mariko, Tsutomu superficially excavates into Mariko's prologue of finding the male libido rather than her character content as a person being the sole reason Mariko has been on so many dates. Tsutomu ultimately has more questions than answers as he tries to interpret the data he has seen regarding Mariko as he explains his perspective of Mariko as a misguided but not necessarily evil girl when Mikako is admonishing caution.",

Mikako's frustration is exponentially amplified with Hiroaki's perspective in Tsutomu's defense; unable to acknowledge her emotional fallibility, Mikako prosecutes an adversarial divergent concourse with Tsutomu prior to the school commute the next morning. Tsutomu's perspective of Mariko as a misguided person rather than a copulation milestone confounds both Yuusuke and Jiro when the boys set course for class; Mariko approaching Tsutomu with an entreaty for his lunchtime company inspires iconoclastic analytical concourse over the entire school. It seems that Mikako has interpreted Hiroaki's counsel as simply not allowing Tsutomu's activities with Mariko to affect her; this quickly becomes the elephant in the room but not by a large enough margin for Sensei Hamada to not detain Mikako after school. About the only silver lining is Tsutomu admiring Yuusuke's motorcycle before offering to escort Mikako home...or, he would have if not for Mariko's pre-emptive exhortation. Yuusuke volunteering himself becomes the preamble for him ironically falling for Mikako when she treats him to a »Thanks for the ride!!!« home-cooked meal; still, one has to ultimately wonder about the aftermath when everything is finally resolved.",

Yuusuke is shocked to find that casually courting Mikako is easier said than done, especially when she is focused on her vendetta with the newly-arrived Mariko whose volition for Tsutomu is his company during a shopping trip. While Mikako prosecutes a a euphoric nocturnal engagement with Risa and P-chan where it is proposed to create a social circle from scratch, Ruriko converses with Hiroaki as she reminisces over her collaborative prologue with Mikako who once attempted a medically dangerous stunt as a child. Mikako gives the matter some serious thought and announces her decision the next morning —- a social circle that makes handmade items to sell at flea markets. The irony here lies in Jiro's inquiry of whether anybody can truly join cornering Mikako into a conundrum where her jealousy is the liability it actually is; fortunately, Mikako wisely demonstrates that her love for her new social circle is ultimately much greater than her hatred for Mariko as she races home past a very relieved Ruriko to get right to work.",

Yuusuke calls on the exhausted Jiro the next morning for a meal due to having been caught with his micro-economic pants down while Mikako and Tsutomu prosecute their daily school commute while trying to fully awaken. While Mikako tabulates Tsutomu's fond recount of his karaoke concert for Mariko and her friends in preparation for an appropriate response, Yuusuke nearly dumps Jiro on the pavement in a mad dash to school where Mikako exhorts everybody to come up with a name for the social circle before the bell rings to signal the start of class. While the girls have the question answered as to what they will sell at the flea market, Yuusuke is at a loss for how to contribute to the flea market before discovering his proficiency in art; after an unsuccessful brainstorming session, the concourse gravitating toward the rationale for enrolling in Yazaku strikes a chord within Jiro who has been grappling with that very issue from the start. The deus ex machina solution to what to call the social circle, Jiro's contribution to the flea market, and the rationale behind Jiro's attendance at Yazaku lies in the dream sequence that explains his prologue of proficiency at playing video games and how a classmate named Chika Ishida suggested that he investigate how to program them after sharing her dream to be an akindo for tea.",

It quickly becomes evident the next morning that the stress has overtaken Mikako when she immediately takes the boys' absence along with Mariko's as a personal affront and races off much to P-chan and Risa's shock; after having the situation explained to him, Hiroaki advises Mikako to put into perspective both the Akindo circle and her issues with Tsutomu's relationship with Mariko who Tsutomu explains has offered her apartment as Akindo headquarters. Mikako's relief at Tsutomu's dedication does very little to compensate for her vendetta with Mariko; a frenzied foot race later, Tsutomu explains his activities yesterday and Mikako acknowledges her fallibility. Upon returning to Mariko's apartment with the raw materials necessary for the accessories that she wishes to make, Mikako ultimately realizes why the word »assume« is spelled the way it is when she has it explained that Yuusuke and Jiro have been as busy as Tsutomu has been.",

Once at the fairgrounds, Mikako wastes no time in taking charge much to Tsutomu's frustration and even counsels P-chan who has a bad case of stage fright. Mariko taking it upon herself to advertise the Akindo shop to help the other six members better do their thing obfuscates a little girl named Shizuka wandering around with an iconoclastic volition for Yuusuke to fulfill...that is, once he sees the folly in scaring away the customers; a brief adversarial divergent concourse later, Yuusuke sets course for a destination arcane that Shizuka promptly emulates only to find that Shizuka gives as good as she gets and insists upon the commerce she is more than willing to pay for while the other Akindo members have gotten back on track—especially since Mariko has brought back more merchandise. No sooner does Yuusuke get compensated for his commerce than Shizuka cries out a negation for her grandfather's company that conscripts him into a high stakes hide-and-go-seek game that requires the other Akindo members; upon having Shizuka's prologue explained to him, Yuusuke's contrition serves at the deus ex machina for Shizuka's reconciliation with her grandfather and for P-chan to do an excellent job of keeping shop to ultimately sell out everything.",

Noriji immediately assumes that the two are paramours and tries to compute how to respond before deciding to tell a very frustrated Tsutomu who bursts out laughing at the prospect before daydreaming back to kindergarten when he observed Ruriko conversing with Hiroaki about his high school exams and concluding that Hiroaki having a crush on Ruriko is not really out of the question before deciding to go out for a walk. A demonstration of how Noriji concluded what he did panics Tsutomu into racing home and right into Mikako who forces his hand. As is usually the case, Noriji is clumsy with demonstrating his good intentions; the anguished Mikako hides herself away while Tsutomu frantically searches for her before recruiting Hiroaki to assist him—the deus ex machina of which is Mikako recalling her prologue with Hiroaki coming to fetch her from kindergarten when her mother had forgotten all about her along with Hiroaki coming to explain the whole situation.",

Concerned about Mikako even though they are on opposite teams, Tsutomu rushes to the rescue and finds that Mikako has recovered herself into a collusive game plan with Yuusuke who has a much healthier perspective of the Festival and gains new insight about her. The next day, Yuusuke and Tsutomu end up availing the sprint time study as the vehicle to resolve their rivalry over Mikako only to end up as the anchors for the relay race. The ultimate irony of the relay race is that as badly as she wants her teammate Yuusuke to win, Mikako starts to realize that Tsutomu has already won her heart many times over.",

Mariko accidentally hitting close to home while teasing Tsutomu instigates the deus ex machina epiphany that there is no way that she can ever have any euphoric convergent chemistry with Tsutomu who conscripts her into a hasty retreat when several fangirls accost the pair; an exchange of prologues and perspectives later, Mariko ultimately resolves herself to returning to Yokohama to resolve her prologue while Tsutomu takes responsibility for succumbing to Yuusuke's counterproductive wheedling and intercedes on Mikako's behalf.",

For Ruriko, who seems to think that Akindo is a biker gang, the one thing that Mikako is after is beyond her economy's ability to easily bankroll it. It does not help matters that Ruriko wanders in on Mikako before an advertisement for adult entertainment and that Mikako refuses to properly explain what she plans to do while out and about.

The ultimate irony is that while the newly-licensed Tsutomu is in seventh heaven that Mikako has successfully acquired the motorbike, it will be a calendar year before Tsutomu can piggyback any passengers—the calendar year in which Mikako could have saved up her money for the bike.",

The ironic deus ex machina is that Shintaro's frustration at the whole situation with Akindo forcing him to do all the work prompting him to walk off the job becomes the forum for Mariko and Ayumi to resolve their differences once Masshu does a »Shintaro« on Ayumi. Mariko and Ayumi working together much to Yuusuke's surprise, Tsutomu eventually finding Mikako to deliver a stern admonition against her subterfuge, Mikako confessing that she has given up on her parents . . . those things ultimately do nothing to assuage the shock of Ruriko discovering Mikako's signature at Hirohiko's exhibit using her former surname.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Ruriko tries her best to concentrate on synthesizing a manga but has difficulty placing all the data she has of Mikako's subterfuge in perspective when Mikako announces that she has prepared breakfast and intends the Akindo studio as her destination. Mikako computing for the correct solution since the subterfuge is not sustainable quickly takes a back seat to Mariko having buried the hatchet with Ayumi much to the astonishment of the other Akindo members. It is not long before Mariko's abrupt but well-planned orders begin to bear fruit as the Akindo members remark that Mariko should avail herself as an expertise consultant for a living. The Akindo members taking a recess for lunch is when it becomes evident that Ruriko is medically in a bad way -- Mikako not being much better off; while Jiro guides Mariko through using the computer, the other Akindo members continue working on the studio. Yuusuke repulsing Tsutomu's playful derision ultimately becomes the deus ex machina for encountering Shishou whose delivery of a dangerous opportunity for both Mikako and Risa expedites the Akindo members successfully finishing up the studio; the euphoria fools Mikako into living on borrowed time.",

Tsutomu is not fooled by Mikako obfuscating her frustration with her family government with a fiery determination to make a star performance at the next flea market; while Tsutomu wonders what he can do, Hirohiko reminisces about the good old days when he and Ruriko were both raising Mikako together as he wonders how to bring that about once more. While Ruriko continues with her manga synthesis, Kuro senses that Ruriko is medically in a bad way but realizes that he cannot help Ruriko by himself; thanks to Mikako complying Tsutomu's time limit on beginning her home commute, Kuro effects an SOS rendezvous with Mikako who detects something amiss when she finds Ruriko's uneaten breakfast. Absent-mindedly repulsing Kuro's »Let us keep searching« exhibitionism ultimately becomes the ironic deus ex machina for Mikako to literally stumble over Ruriko -- and a very poignant warning about her maladaptive conduct.",

This brings no relief to either Mikako who has yet to resolve her hidden issues with Ruriko; Noriji volunteering to fill out the paperwork and Yuusuke calling it a night obfuscates Mikako making a trip to the bathroom in which she is torn over whether to tell Hirohiko about what happened to Ruriko oblivious to Tsutomu having made the choice for her. The ironic silver lining in Mikako's protracted absence is that it has ultimately set the stage for Mikako to finally realize that she never had to go it alone and that Tsutomu has already demonstrated his promise of perpetual proximity and attentive availability many times over.",

Mariko inadvertently ignites a divergent concourse with Yuusuke and storms away in frustration before Risa decides to go visit Ruriko by herself. As the other Akindo members get right to work, Mikako is finding that there is more wrong with Ruriko than the stomach ulcer when she has it explained that Ruriko has been harboring several anxieties and has proof of Mikako's subterfuge with Hirohiko. The air cleared between mother and daughter, Risa visiting with flowers helps with the tense ambiance of the already-stormy office politics between Ruriko and her editor; ironically, this becomes the forum for Ayumi to catalyze Yuusuke and Mariko's reconciliation. The deus ex machina that ultimately resolves things arrives in the form of Hirohiko paying a visit the next day; relieved of her parents' marital drama, Mikako jubilantly sets course for the Akindo studio with Tsutomu right on her heels.",

While Ruriko customizes herself, Hirohiko takes upon himself the stewardship of escorting Ruriko after he sends Noriji and Hiroaki on their way to the flea market where the other Akindo members execute one transaction after another until a casually-dressed gentleman approaches Mikako to signal an interest in her merchandise after some iconoclastic analysis. Kaoru Hirosaki having favorably appraised her, Hirohiko and Ruriko deciding to play things by ear as they try to find common ground . . . those events help Mikako to ultimately come to grips the assets that she has in her midst in Tsutomu and the Akindo gang.",
