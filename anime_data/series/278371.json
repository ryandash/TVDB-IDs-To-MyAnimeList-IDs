Meanwhile, as Akane and Clay escort Anya towards the airport, the city is suddenly overrun by NOT students turned into Traitors, which the EAT students have to fend off. As Tsugumi states her belief that Anya won't leave the city, mentioning the feelings she sensed from her, Jacqueline, sensing what Tsugumi may be going through, has Kim heal her injuries and lets her go off to help her friends. Hitching a ride with Liz and Patty, Tsugumi reunites with Anya, the two resolving to rescue Meme and managing to perform a Soul Resonance, which gives Tsugumi's halberd form wings. Sensing the two's bonds, Akane directs them towards Stein, who admires their resolve and gives them an antidote made from Meme's blood. Following a messenger bat, Tsugumi and Anya soon arrive at the top of a bell tower, where Shaula and Meme await.",

Shaula then sends Meme to kill Tsugumi and Anya, with Anya attempting to subdue her to give Tsugumi the chance to administer the antidote. Overcoming her fears, Tsugumi manages to break open Meme's guard and administer the antidote via a kiss. Whilst it doesn't appear to work at first, Tsugumi risks herself to get Meme to remember the times they've spent together, managing to perform a Soul Resonance with her and break her free from Shaula's mind control. Tsugumi then makes the decision to make both Anya and Meme her official partners, believing the three of them can resonate together. Using the remnants of Meme's link to track down Shaula, the girls perform a three-way Soul Resonance to bring out Tsugumi's true form, combining all of their strengths to defeat Shaula, returning all of the infect students back to normal. Some time later, after Anya sorts out some royal business and Meme gets a medial check-up, the two return back to Tsugumi, who has been studying hard whilst waiting for her partners.",
