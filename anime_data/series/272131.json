Meanwhile, Masayoshi is called to the hospital by Joji, who had heard someone mention Samurai Flamenco before he was hit by the truck, telling him that he needs to learn to love to become stronger. As Masayoshi becomes hung up over what that means, Sumi offers to give him advice about his situation, asking Akira to investigate Haiji before teaching Masayoshi about the various types of love. Meanwhile, Haiji lures Hidenori into a trap and kidnaps him, instructing Masayoshi to go to his old apartment.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Hidenori recalls how he started sending messages to himself after his girlfriend went missing, despite attempts from his mother to get him to stop, eventually joining the police force in the hopes of one day finding her. Back in the present, Haiji attempts to drive Hidenori into killing him by deleting the texts that have kept him going all this time. After hearing from Akira that Haiji had his parents fake his death, Masayoshi arrives at the apartment to confront Haiji, who desires to turn Samurai Flamenco into a 'dark hero' by having Hidenori kill him. Believing fighting him as Samurai Flamenco won't solve anything, Masayoshi strips naked in order to confront him as himself. As Hidenori tries to aim Haiji's gun at him, Masayoshi stands in his way and manages to calm him down in his own way, whilst Mari apprehends Haiji. Six months later, a museum is opened to celebrate heroes, whilst Masayoshi, who occasionally pays visits to Haiji, continues to act as Samurai Flamenco to help solve the little crimes.",
