Magecraft is comprised of techniques from past humans that cannot be explained by science, while science encompasses the techniques of  future humans that Magecraft cannot achieve. Researchers and scholars of both Magecraft and science have been gathered to\r\nmaintain human civilization under the Chaldea Security Organization. But calculations then proved the extinction of humanity in 2019.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this is “realms that cannot be observed” that suddenly appeared in various eras of history, called “Singularities”.\r\nRitsuka Fujimaru, the one Master remaining in Chaldea, has been intervening within these Singularites, alongside the Demi-Servant Mash Kyrielight. He has been attending to the forbidden rituals to resolve or destroy the Singularities: the “Grand Order”.",

The Chaldea Security Organization was founded to focus on preserving the continuation of human history. They observe a world which magecraft couldn't observe and science couldn't measure all to prevent the certain extinction of humanity. But one day, the future that Chaldea continued to observe disappears and humanity's extinction in 2017 becomes clear. Rather, it had already happened. The cause seems to be related to Fuyuki, a provincial town in Japan, in the year 2004 CE. There, an \"unobservable region\" that had not existed before appears. Based on the assumption that Fuyuki is the reason for humanity's extinction, Chaldea issues an order to explore, investigate, and possibly destroy this singularity – a quest for the Holy Grail, the Grand Order.",
