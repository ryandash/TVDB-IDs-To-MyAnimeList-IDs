Narumi is getting beaten up, but then the guys from the dojo show up to dish out some pain. Realizing his weakness, Narumi asks the Fourth, leader of the dojo, to perform a sake ritual with him to formally induct him into the dojo. With that done, there is still the problem of the money Meo has. However, Narumi gets the idea to split the money into small portions and transfer them all into Kusakabe's bank account (Kusakabe is Meo's father), scheduling all of it to be transferred to the corporation that's after Meo, the Kishiwada Corporation. Because the money is dirty, it will cause problems for the Yakuza members. The Yakuza freak out, but Narumi later reveals that it was just a bluff. However, the company is forced to bring Kusakabe to stop the “transaction”, as the account is in his name. When they show up, the Fourth and the guys from the dojo proceed to beat the crap out of them. Meo shows up, and Kusakabe breaks free after seeing her. Distracted by the touching scene, Narumi gets punched in the face by Tetsu (his own ally). The next day, Narumi arrives to find Meo preparing to go out with her father in Alice's room, much to Alice's dismay. However, the case is closed and everyone lives happily ever after.",

Turns out one of the band's former promoters is the Yanagihara Group, who have ties with the Yakuza. The band didn't want that group to sponsor them, so they turned to the Fourth. However, it's possible that the Yanagihara Group bites back. Narumi starts to promote and help out with the concert. While he's out alone, he runs into a man named Hirasaka, who is being threatened by some thugs. He starts to beat the crap out of them, but Narumi stops him by pouring his drink on Hirasaka's shirt. He later introduces himself as Renji and forces Narumi to buy him some clothes. While they're at a restaurant, Renji notices some thugs out the window and runs off. Later that day, Minli asks Narumi to go out and pick up an apron for her, but he runs into the Fourth at the shop. The Fourth gets really angry seeing Narumi and orders him not to tell anyone about the shop. The shop's owner, Yoshiki, starts to tell Narumi embarrassing things about the Fourth, which greatly annoys him.

Also, Alice shows up, having worried about Narumi because he didn't pick up his phone and his GPS was by the fire. The Fourth also calls Narumi to ask him about the fire as well as tell him that they have found the one who stole their t-shirts in the last episode. Narumi shows up to see the culprit, and the culprit starts saying random things about angels and mentions Hirasaka. The Fourth then beats the crap out of him, but later tells Narumi that there was another person that had the key to the room with the t-shirts. He tells Narumi that the true culprit is none other than Hirasaka Renji. Later, Alice asks Narumi about his strange behavior and he tells her about his meeting with Hirasaka Renji. The next day, he confronts the Fourth and tells him that he met Renji. The Fourth starts to question him, but Narumi refuses to talk, telling him to seek Alice's help. The Fourth refuses, telling Narumi to stay away from Renji. Narumi goes out with Ayaka and a couple of the guys from the dojo join them for protection. Narumi is able to lose them easily, though, but they end up getting attacked by some guys. However, Tetsu shows up in time to help them out. That night, Narumi gets a call from Renji asking him to meet up and return his shirt. Before he goes, he visits Alice, who tells him about the evil of Hirasaka Renji. Narumi still intends to return the shirt, though, which causes Alice to start throwing things at him. She then gives him one of her stuffed animals, an owl that will “protect” him, and lets him sleep on her bed that night with her.

Renji tells Narumi that he will kill him if he sees him again, but Narumi tries to convince Renji to tell him the story between the Fourth and him. Renji starts to tell him, revealing that the Fourth and him lived together with a girl named Hison before. The two men had an agreement that neither would make a move on Hison and that both would protect her from other men. Renji tells Narumi that the Fourth used Hison as a shield in a fight against the Gotouda Group, causing her death. Renji vows revenge and tells Narumi to stay out of it. Narumi later talks with Yoshiki, who tells him a bit about the Fourth. Narumi realizes how much the Fourth cared about Renji and calls him to beg him to ask Alice for help. The Fourth later comes by the ramen shop to finally ask Alice to help him out, and he finds out that the other NEETs were already on it. Narumi confronts the Fourth about Hison, but the Fourth refuses to tell him more. He later asks Alice, who warns him that investigating may cause him to lose a friend, but he chooses to do so anyway. Narumi later finds out from Hiroaki that on the day of Hison's death, the Fourth was seen with a bleeding shoulder as well. More importantly, there were reports of another woman's voice coming from the apartment. He rushes over to the Fourth to find that the butterfly tattoo on his shoulder actually covers that scar, so he concludes that the men were actually after Hison, not the Fourth. The Fourth refuses to tell him anything, so he goes to talk with Alice again, who tells him that the Gotouda Group's leader divorced his wife right after Hison's death, which leads her to conclude that the culprit is the ex-wife. She also concludes that Hison was pregnant, due to the fact that she was stabbed in the abdomen. Alice tells Narumi that he needs to hurry and tell Renji the truth about the incident, but Narumi gets a call as he leaves that the Fourth has been attacked.",

Narumi goes back to the ramen shop to find the rest of the guys ready to go out and kill Renji, but he is able to stop them from dirtying the Fourth's name and they acknowledge him as leader. Later, Alice warns Narumi that Renji had miscalculated because of Narumi and that he will come after him soon. Narumi goes back to his job helping with the concert and the day of the concert arrives. Narumi isolates himself and has the vocals of the band wear a replica of Renji's shirt to lure him out, which succeeds. Alice appears to reveal that the embroidery on Renji's real shirt is the same as that of Narumi's concert shirt. She concludes that they must have been made by the same person. Alice reveals that Hison survived, but lost her womb in the incident, and that she is actually the owner of the shop Narumi had visited so many times, having taken the name Yoshiki. Renji asks why the Fourth hid everything and Alice responds that he was trying to protect Renji from the information that Hison was with the Gotouda Group's leader and pregnant. The Fourth then shows up in his injured state to confirm everything. The Fourth and Renji get into a fistfight and finally resolve their issues. The concert goes off without a hitch and Narumi later returns to the ramen shop to find Renji's sunglasses there.

Major argues against them, and they propose a gamble with the loser backing off, which Tetsu agrees to immediately. They point at a Powerebo machine and say they will use baseball to decide the winner and Major accepts. However, Major doesn't realize that they are talking about a real baseball game. Major starts to try to round up a team, and the Fourth shows up with some guys from the Hirasaka Group to fill up the remaining slots. Alice decides to become the coach for the team. The day of the game approaches, and Alice reveals that their opponents are quite the tough bunch. Narumi reveals to the rest of the NEETs that Nemo was formerly a baseball player. The day of the game arrives, and the NEETs start strong with the Fourth's pitching, but Nemo comes out to hit a home run on the first pitch. The NEET Teddy Bears are able to stay relatively even with the Yakuza team, but Nemo has yet to pitch. The Fourth is reaching his limit, and Alice laments the lack of data on Nemo, so Narumi rushes back to the arcade to check if the game has any information. Finally, Nemo comes to the mound. With the Fourth out of commission, two outs, and a runner on first, Narumi steps up to bat in the Fourth's place. However, Alice finally comes out into the open to take Narumi's place. Nemo has trouble with the first couple of pitches, but gets three strikes on Alice. However, the last pitch is not caught and Alice makes a break for the bases.

Alice tells him that she knows why she would want to kill herself, but doesn't know why she chose the school roof, which was too low to ensure death. Just like Narumi, Alice blames herself for not stopping Ayaka, but Narumi is able to comfort her. She then officially makes Narumi her assistant for this case. The next day, Alice orders Narumi to go to the greenhouse, where the Fourth is waiting.

Toshi was one of Hakamizaka's distributors, using Ayaka to grow the raw ingredients. The Fourth mobilizes everyone under him to create a giant search party for those responsible for Angel Fix.
