  "SummaryEnglish": "30 young men and women who came together on a shady bus tour. The tour's destination: an elusive, and possibly non-existent village called Nanakimura. In Nanakimura, one can lead a utopian existence, free of the world's obstacles... or so it was rumored. The bus headed deep into the mountains, carrying 30 people each harboring their own expectations and wounds in their hearts... What they had arrived to was an uninhabited village with the lingering faint scents of life, even though it was falling apart. Just what is the truth of Nanakimura?",
