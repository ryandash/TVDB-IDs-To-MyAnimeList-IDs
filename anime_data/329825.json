  "SummaryEnglish": "Based on COLOPL's school action role-playing game. Set in the year 2045.

Standing boldly against these invaders are ordinary girls everywhere, without a powerful army or even weapons.

The player is assigned to this academy to train the girls and take back the contaminated Earth. And so, once again, the chimes echo through the sun-strewn schoolyard to mark the beginning of classes today...",
