One of the Western Block's top agents, Mylene Hoffman — an enhanced female cyborg, codename 009-1 — experiences on a day to day basis, what it means to be a pawn in this deadly game of spy vs. spy. Even though the war may be cold, it still means bloodshed. And each mission 009-1 almost miraculously overcomes, makes her question the ethics of her profession more and more...",
