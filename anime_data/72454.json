The star of the show revealed himself to be very disagreeable with the rest of the cast, one of whom, Ruri Amaki (雨城 琉璃, Amaki Ruri?) turned out to be a fellow classmate of Kogoro when they were children. Ruri revealed to Ran and Conan who were present that she, Kogoro, and Kisaki, were classmates since kindergarten. Ran and Conan learned that the brainy Kisaki and the underachiever Kogoro seemed inexplicably drawn to each other, to quarrel. As the other classmates suspected, time showed that the arguments were intended to disguise their mutual attraction. The star challenged Kogoro to solve the mystery of the murder scene being filmed. To prevent Kogoro from embarrassing himself, Conan used the tranquilizer dart on Kogoro and cracked the puzzle with the clues present. During a break in the filming, the star was discovered with his throat slit, with Ruri over the body and her hands bloody.",

While one scours the empty building, the other remains behind in one of the rooms on the fourth floor, with Conan and Ai kept tied up and gagged in the open and their other victim sealed away in a locker.

The plan eventually works: Frazzled with their continuous lack of success in apprehending the kids and contacing their kidnapee's daughter, the second culprit temporarily leaves the room in order to help in the search. The culprits eventually come behind the ruse, but by the time they react, it is already too late: Conan knocks their guard out with his tranquilizer watch and prepares to ambush his accomplice, unaware that the latter has in the meantime encountered someone on the stairs.
