    "SummaryEnglish": "Konpeki no Kantai is a Japanese alternate-history original video animation series produced by JC Staff. Based on a 1992 novel by Yoshio Aramaki, the series focuses on a technologically advanced Imperial Japanese Navy and a radically different Pacific War that was brought about by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's revival in the past due to unexplained circumstances. The series also features real-life 1940s figures whose first names were changed, such as Winston Churchill to Kingston Churchill and Adolf Hitler to Heinrich von Hitler.",

The Germans launch Jormungands modified with jet engines out of Trondheim to attack the Japanese base, but run into heavy flak, Sorai-Kai fighters, and fighters that launch missiles with guided sub-munitions.

The Japanese in turn, attack the German fleet carriers. Aboard the German flagship Lothringen, Von Rabe is considering withdrawing, but his junior, Wilhelm Rosenberg, knocks him out with a pistol whip and orders the battleships to cross the T and fire at the Yamato Takeru. However, the ship avoids the barrages using its advanced turbofan thrusters and special anti-torpedo cannons, allowing enough time for the I-3000 to get through and destroy the battleships. Meanwhile, the Germans push back the Allied invasion of Europe (despite the US launching a second invasion, named Operation Nirvana) and force an armistice on them. They also complete their conquest of southern England.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Rommel's mechanized forces tighten the grip on Stalin's forces in the winter of 1949. Hitler and Manteuffel consider purging Rommel when he completes the rout of the Soviets' Ural fortress. However, some dissident Nazis eavesdrop on the plan and alert the Japanese, who send IJA Maj Yoshiaki Hongo as a courier to talk to Rommel. Faced with the threat of assassination by Nazi loyalists in the Wehrmacht, Rommel encourages a good portion of his forces to join him in leaving the main invasion army. They cross the Altai mountains and head to safety in Ulanbataar despite heavy winter conditions. He is extracted to Japan for a meeting with Otaka about establishing a Free German government-in-exile. On May 1, 1950 the People's Republic of East Siberia is established at Khabarovsk with Leon Trokki as its first Premier. As Maebara returns to Jaluit, Takasugi visits the submarine base.",

An Enigma codebook captured during the raid helps Maebara create a fake message to force the Germans to divide their ships, allowing the Japanese to wreak havoc with ease. The SNLF also invades St Helena. The Luftwaffe rolls out the new Do 317 Ares delta-wing strategic bomber as part of Operation \"Sickle Iron Cross.\" The US decides to send military forces to Argentina, but are cut to ribbons by U-boats. Elsewhere, the Soviets finally capitulate, but it is not known if Stalin killed himself.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Admiral Takasugi and Commander Kawasaki meet Macarthur in Madagascar to discuss future combat missions. The Germans launch Operation \"Sickle Iron Cross\" using their squadron of Ares bombers flying out of Mauritania plus a fleet deploying from the south of France. Manteuffel, who is personally commanding the operation from a base in Nouakchott, said the plan's success relies on the elimination of the Yamato Takeru, which helms the fleet just 120 kilometers from Dakar. The Japanese attack the German ships while docked at a naval base by triggering an oil spill at the harbor and lighting them up. Any ship that tries to get out is destroyed. The bombers deal moderate damage to the Japanese fleet with their onboard rocket launchers. The Yamato Takeru fights off the Ares bombers and an Angrboda II flying-wing bomber with its AA weapons. The battleship is being targeted by several German torpedoes, but the I-3000 goes full throttle to shake them off.",

The Japanese also evacuate the population of Tristan da Cunha. Manteuffel declares his victory over the fleet to Hitler, who suddenly fumes that he failed after reading a newspaper that features the Yamato Takeru's arrival in New York on a goodwill visit. He has Manteuffel executed by the SS. A German column in the Tian Shan mountains is ambushed by IJA attack helicopters and Mongolian Tiger tanks in a delaying action, to buy time for strategic bombers to go in for the kill. In England, Japanese and British forces push on to liberate London. With the successful stopping of the Germans, Japan joins the US and Britain in Muscat for peace talks with Nazi Germany, which is a success (despite the Third Reich keeping much of its territory and forced to leave all of Siberia",
