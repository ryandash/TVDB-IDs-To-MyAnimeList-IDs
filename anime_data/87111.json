  "TitleEnglish": "Starship Troopers",
  "SummaryEnglish": "Starship Troopers (宇宙の戦士 ,Uchū no Senshi?, lit. Soldiers of Space) is a six part anime OVA by Sunrise, based on the book Starship Troopers by Robert A. Heinlein. This production is considered the \"most faithful\" to the original novel's plot, despite the fact that many liberties were taken with the characters and the original book's themes. For instance, Rico, an Asian Filipino in the novel, is a Blonde White Argentine in the OVA. Interestingly, the main character's ethnicity in the OVA series has more in common with the Verhoeven's Starship Troopers (film) than the source material--this despite their productions being wholly unrelated and having nearly a decade of difference.",
