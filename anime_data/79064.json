However, facilities were not completed in time, leading Nishiman's group and the Earth returnees to be occupied with daily tasks back on Earth. The ongoing efforts involve maintaining Plateau Island, welcoming and monitoring the pirates, but now Earth's overseers have arrived, introducing hectic days. In an unexpected turn, a family of Earthlings decides to relocate. Hearing that only the young boy is arriving first, the overseer \"Nanda\" struggles with the adjustments, adding another layer of complexity to the bustling situation.",
