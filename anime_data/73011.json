In the “Immortal Grand Prix,” two teams of three IG machines, high-tech humanoid mechs driven by humans, race at speeds greater than 400km/h. The teams make three laps of a 60 km course while intercepting the opponent as they vie for a first place finish.

Now it looks like things are about to change and luck (or so it seems) is on their side. The defending champions have been taken out of IG-1 Grand Prix 2035 and a random drawing to choose a team as their replacements reveals that Team Suzaku will take their place with young 14-year-old Takeshi Noah as their leader."
