    "TitleEnglish": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood",
    "SummaryEnglish": "Edward and Alphonse Elric's reckless disregard for alchemy's fun­damental laws ripped half of Ed's limbs from his body and left Al's soul clinging to a cold suit of armor. To restore what was lost, the brothers scour a war-torn land for the Philosopher's Sto­ne, a fabled relic which grants the ability to perform alchemy in impossible ways. The Elrics are not alone in their search; the corrupt State Military is also eager to harness the artifact's power. So too are the strange Homunculi and their shadowy creator. The mythical gem lures exotic alchemists from distant kingdoms, scarring some deeply enough to inspire murder. As the Elrics find their course altered by these enemies and allies, their purpose remains unchanged – and their bond unbreakable.",

However, the Madam refuses to teach Ed about the techniques used. Rosalie leads Al to a room with a little girl's shriveled corpse inside. She reveals this as the result of the real Rosalie's transmutation, whilst she herself is a girl named Amy who was adopted due to her similar appearance. As Ed arrives on the scene, the Madam tells him that her late husband kept the truth about the transmutation's failure from Judau, who truly wanted to resurrect Rosalie. Ed and Al then leave, carrying this knowledge with them as well.",

Winry explains that she decided to pierce her ears after meeting Riza on the day Ed decided to become a State Alchemist. Meanwhile, Riza explains to her colleague that she grew her hair long after meeting Winry that same day. Her colleague comments on how simple a reason that is, and Riza says that reasons are always simple. To explain her choice, she remarks that they are all living in a simple world - where when they shoot their enemies, their enemies die.",

After the war broke out, Bradley passed a document announcing the extermination of the Ishbalans. This takes it toll on many alchemists, including Roy which isn't helped by the taunts of Kimblee, who enjoys killing. As Marcoh tells Scar his side of the story, he reveals that he was involved in using Isbalans to make the Philosopher's Stone, which was given to the state alchemists to enhance their alchemy. The Ishbalan leader tried pleading with Bradley to end the killing in exchange for his life, but was rejected. When the war finally ended, Roy resolved that he would work to become the new Fuhrer to protect the people and appointed Riza as her second-in-command. Riza mentions to Ed that when they finally achieve peace, they may have to be punished for the people they have killed. When Envy checks Marcoh's cell, he finds nothing left but a beheaded corpse and the word \"vengeance\" written in blood on the wall.",
