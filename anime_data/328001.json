However, Rohmonov denies Mahmut, as getting involved in politics goes against the merchant law. At the market, Mahmut and co. see Niki Al-Bahram, a young girl whose merchant father recently passed away and has inherited his trading license, being dismissed by her father's former workers and business partners. Mahmut and co. offer to help Niki, though he warns her of the dangers that his plans will incite and that she will be breaking the Argyros's merchant laws. Niki accepts Mahmut's offer and starts her new caravan by selling highly prized Türkiye jewels, though Mahmut and his group disguised themselves as women to hide from Rohmonov. Still wanting to start eastern trade relations, Mahmut has Niki set up a meeting with Wan Yixin, a native from the eastern country of Çinili and someone with close ties to the emperor. After Mahmut convinces Wan that a business transaction that will bring peace to Çinili, Wan agrees to order an enormous shipment of Venedik glass, which made Venedik purchase all the wheat from Tharros to use as box padding. As the wheat was meant to be provisions for Balt-Rhein's invasion campaign against Türkiye, Louis orders the naval fleet stationed at Phoiníkē to intercept the shipments. This resulted in a naval battle between Venedik and the empire, who lost the fight and are imprisoned. Mahmut is pleased that he was able to pit Venedik and Balt-Rhein against each other, earning Venedik as an ally for Türkiye and stalling Balt-Rhein's invasion plans against his homeland."

However, the empire's shipment of wheat was attacked by pirates and Admiral Lowe concludes that Venedik has purposely made sure the pirates run free in their territory, realizing Venedik now considers them an enemy. Meanwhile, Mahmut, Abiriga, Kyros, and Niki travel to the northern country of Urado, a strict isolationist nation that shares a border with Balt-Rhien and Greater Türkiye. They meet Cabinet Minister of Türkiye Negotiations, Princess Margit, and her father, King Zsigmond III. As Margit gives them a tour, Mahmut and co. learn that Urado is a poverty-stricken state and how the citizens are struggling to survive. Later, Abiriga deduces that the foul smell emanating from the coastline cliffs is fossilized bird feces, which produces high quality fertilizer. Mahmut determines that the fertilizer will help revitalize Urado. Late at night, Mahmut and co. are summoned by Zsigmond, Margit, and Princess Gertrud to the meeting hall, alongside an ambassador from Balt-Rhein. Zsigmond declares that Urado will enter a treaty with the empire, giving them passage to their territory in exchange for goods. Sensing Zsigmond's reluctance, Mahmut explains that the fertilizer from the coastlines will help revive Urado and that if they ally with Türkiye, they will help Urado trade with eastern countries. After Mahmut points out that the empire's cruel treatment of nations they annexed and how they will force Urado to go to war, Zsigmond chooses to ally with Türkiye and orders the Imperial envoy to be executed as a shown of trust."

At the Centro, Venedik notice that their rival nation, Republic of L'isonlani, was seen violating the secret pact between the eleven Centro nations by aiding the empire's navy ships from pirate attacks. Brega speaks with L'isonlani's Doge Doria, who falsely promises to honor the pact, but has secretly sided with the empire. When claims of a plague spread around the Centro, Brega's crew are forced to quarantine themselves for forty days. In the meantime, Doge Lucio suspects this is a ploy and L'isonlani has sided with the empire. After setting up the alliance with Urado, Mahmut and co. return to the Türkiye Stratocracy and meet with Lucio, who proposes a meeting to be held between all five stratocracies of Greater Türkiye, Urado, and Venedik. Once all the leaders assembles, Mahmut mediates the tension between Lucio and Zsigmond, who find Venedik untrustworthy. Once they hear that an Imperial-L'isonlani naval fleet has set up a blockade between east and west Centro, the Tripartite Military Alliance is formed to counteract the growing threat. Choosing to travel by land to confront the empire in Western Centro, Mahmut, Süleyman, and co. are assigned to convince the Cuore di Rumeliana nations to allow the Turkish army passage through their lands as Halil is appointed general of the Turkish army. At the same time, the Balt-Rhein army begins their fearsome invasion in South Rumeliana."

After learning that they must get the Republic of Florence's permission to allow the Turkish army passage through their territory, the group heads there and sets up a meeting with Gonfaloniere Caterina di Rossi, the leader of Florence and Süleyman's former lover. While Mahmut attempts to take advantage of their thirty minutes audience, Caterina's cordial mannerisms and flirtatious conduct with Süleyman makes Mahmut too flustered to converse with her. Before leaving, Caterina informs Mahmut and co. that she is fully aware about Balt-Rhein's growing invasion and that an assembly will be held between all the leaders of Cuore republics tomorrow to decide what they will do. Caterina's secretary, Giacomo, and other Anti-Türkiye nobles believe that Caterina should negotiate with Balt-Rhein rather the \"barbaric\" Turks and express their concerns to Caterina, who assures them she won't be allying with the Turks. Meanwhile, Balt-Rhein's invasion continues by conquering Scoglio, who has peacefully surrendered to the empire. With possession of Scolgio and Phoiníkē, General Pineau declares that Balt-Rhein is now the \"heir\" of the former Phoiníkē Empire and that they seek to conquer all its former territory. The Türkiye spy stationed at Scoglio is able to send messenger birds out to his fellow spies before he is killed by Eleanor. Once Süleyman receives the news, Mahmut and the others interrupt the assembly. Caterina announces to them that the Cuore nations has created the Cuore Alliance as the third great continental power."

Enraged at Caterina's decision to side with the Tripartite Military Alliance, Giacomo and the Anti-Türkiye nobles attempts to assassinate her, but are thwarted by Süleyman. Meanwhile, Mahmut, Kyros, and Abiriga travel to South Rumeliana and head to Tauro city, meeting Erbach and El Toro mercenaries on the way. The Tauro's twins mayors, Derecho and Esquerdo, challenge Mahmut to a mock battle if he wants to grant the Turkish army passage. After Mahmut wins, he hires all the Tauro city-based mercenaries to help battle Balt-Rhien, with Erbach joining the group to lead El Toro mercenaries that will follow them. As the Tripartite Military Alliance consolidates their forces, the Imperial army destroys Campana and a young boy named Vasco is the only one to escape the massacre. He meets up with Blanca, a fellow citizen and Türkiye spy, and requests to be taken to the Türkiye stratocracy to help with the war effort. Mahmut continues to steadily gain support from other South Rumeliana cities, but hears that Campana's destruction has caused its neighbors to surrender to the empire, leaving the Republic of Chielo that only city left for Mahmut to ally with."
