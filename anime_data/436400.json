  "SummaryEnglish": "In 1992, a pandemic of viral encephalitis shook the world. The medical technology that saved humanity evolved into \"Your Forma\"—an invasive information device implanted into the brain. In this world where every sight, sound, and even emotion is recorded, investigating major crimes means diving into the collective data, a job reserved for special detectives called \"Electronic Investigator.\" Echika Hieda, a prodigious \"Electronic Investigator\" assigned at an astonishingly young age, stands isolated by her exceptional talent. Her newly assigned partner is Harold, a blonde, blue-eyed humanoid \"Amicus.\" Together, this unrivaled duo will expose every hidden secret.",
