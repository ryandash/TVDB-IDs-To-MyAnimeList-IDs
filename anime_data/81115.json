In a failed attempt to seal a seed properly, he winds up on Earth in the form of a ferret. However, his battle with the seeds did not end upon reaching the Earth and he needs somebody else's help to seal the seeds for him. Takamachi Nanoha hears his telepathic cries for help and comes to his rescue. When she is given a pearl known as the Raging Heart she is able to transform into Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha and wield a staff to fend off the evil that lies within the Seeds. In order to help Yuuno complete his mission, she needs to seal all 21 Jewel Seeds away, but Fate may be playing a hand in the matter to prevent Nanoha's goals.",

          "SummaryEnglish": "Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Reflection (魔法少女リリカルなのはReflection) is the third theatrical anime film in the MGLN franchise. Unlike the previous two films, it will not adapt an existing story (such as StrikerS) but instead feature an original storyline,[2] taking some cue from the plot of The Battle of Aces and The Gears of Destiny but adding original storylines and characters, as well. It is the first part of a two-part story, with the second part titled Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Detonation. The movie was formerly titled Magical Girl Lyrical NANOHA The MOVIE 3rd Reflection, picking up from The MOVIE 2nd A's. On October 2, 2016 (the same day ViVid Strike! went on air), a TV advertisement was released that removed \"The MOVIE 3rd\" from the planned title, to avoid confusion regarding whether the movie is another existing story remake. Nevertheless, it is part of the movie continuity, continuing with the history and designs in The MOVIE 2nd A's. However, as the primary continuity has zero coverage about what has happened between the early spring and winter of 0067,[3] the story of Reflection may somehow be seen as a re-telling or supplement of this blank period.",
