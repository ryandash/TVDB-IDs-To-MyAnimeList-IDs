                    "SummaryEnglish": "It's been a year. Peace has returned, and everyone is back to living their old lives again. Azuma has started living on his own and now attends the same high school as Kogane. All Buranki controlled by Guy's Demokratia have been handed over to government-managed companies. As he watches the news over breakfast and opens a letter from Epizo, Azuma can't help but feel how much quieter his life is now."
