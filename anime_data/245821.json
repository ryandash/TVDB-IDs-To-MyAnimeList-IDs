  "SummaryEnglish": "This story takes place a little further in the future—There are now billions of card game players in the world, to an extent where card games have become a necessity, a part of our lives.The protagonist of this story, Aichi Sendo, is a timid boy in his third year of middle school. He had been living his life looking backward rather than forward, trying not to stand out. However, he had one thing that kept him going - the Blaster Blade, a card from a card game that was given to him when he was little. That card is the reason why he begins to engage in Cardfights, something that changes his life drastically. The name of the card game is Vanguard. The game takes place in a different planet called Cray. It is a place similar to our own planet, but unlike planet Earth, Gods and Demons, Dragons and other mythical creatures still roam the land. It is also a world where both Magic and Science have advanced hand in hand. Countries with advances in different fields and cultures rule over different parts of the planet Cray. And due to a never before seen play system, it becomes popular throughout the world. Aichi, immediately attracted by Vanguard, meets friends such as Misaki Togura and Kamui Katsuragi, along with other rivals. Through friendly rivalry with them, Aichi begins to enjoy a fulfilling life. Aichi, however, has a goal: to once again battle with a Vanguard Fighter by the name of Toshiki Kai. Toshiki Kai is an aloof and cold-hearted high schooler who has outstanding abilities in the world of Vanguard. He is also the reason why Aichi started playing the game. For him, Kai is the person who saved him from his boring life and introduced him to Vanguard. In order to get better at Vanguard, Aichi puts his soul into it every day. He wishes that someday, he'll be able to battle Kai and have him recognize his worth.",

Back to the game, Aichi deals a bit of damage to Kai, who retaliates with his ace card, Dragonic Overlord. It wipes out Aichi's units and greatly damages him. All seems lost until Aichi draws a \"Heal Trigger\", which allows Aichi to stay in the game for one last turn. Aichi launches a final attack with Blaster Blade, which breaks through Kai's defenses and deals one more point of damage to Kai, thus giving Aichi the win. A day later, Aichi revisits the card shop.

Getting his memory back, Kai nonetheless chooses to continue using his current deck, but Aichi is conflicted about using his. Kai tells Aichi that he is bound by his own limits by not wanting to use Gold Paladins and that he needs to break through them. To prove his point, Kai rides Dragonic Kaiser Vermillion, declares \"Final Turn\", and performs Limit Break, an ability that activates when a player has 4 or more damage. With Vermillion's Limit Break, Kai attacks all of Aichi's front-row units in one strike and wins as a result.

The Ultra Rare trio returns, and they discover that their supposedly-closed shop is unlocked. The entire group enters, and they are surprised to find that the legendary cardfighter Daigo is there. It was believed that Daigo had gone missing for months, to which Daigo explains in a private conversation with Ultra Rare that he had been randomly teleporting from place to place. Suiko believes it is because of Daigo's deck, which is composed of Royal Paladins, one of the clans that were removed from the world, and therefore considered legendary by everyone except Aichi. Afterwards, Daigo offers up a challenge to anyone willing to cardfight with him. Before Aichi can accept, Leon steps up to be Daigo's opponent. And so, Team Q4 and Ultra Rare observe the fight between Daigo using Royal Paladins and Leon, whose deck is composed of another legendary clan: Aqua Force. Although Aichi is familiar with Royal Paladins, Daigo uses units that even he has never seen before, including White Dragon Knight, Pendragon. Leon rides Navalgazer Dragon and uses its seemingly-simple Limit Break to increase its attack power by 3000, which Daigo guards against. Daigo then utilizes the Limit Break of Pendragon to superior ride Soul Saver Dragon, using its skill to power up his rear-guards, but Leon defends and makes it to his next turn, which he declares as the \"Final Turn\". After activating the Limit Break of Navalgazer again, he attacks. Daigo tries to block with all of the cards in his hand, but Leon gets a heal trigger, giving the power boost to Navalgazer and breaking through Daigo's defenses. Although Daigo manages to survive thanks to his own heal trigger, Leon then reveals the other effect of Navalgazer's Limit Break; since it successfully attacked the",

However, Kamui cannot comprehend the numerous difficult rules, leaving Aichi and Misaki to pair up and take on Team Lao (the group of three men who they met earlier) in the first round. Throughout the fight, the special rules are exhibited and explained: the fighters must only attack the player standing in front of them, they are forbidden to consult their partners and show the cards in their hands to one another, but they are allowed to call guardians from their hands to block for their partners and share damage for Counterblast uses. Team Lao's Terence and Felix both use Tachikaze decks; Terence's Raptor units deliver major damage to Aichi early on in the fight. Using her new Witch deck, Misaki compensates for Aichi by riding Scarlet Witch, CoCo and using various skills to draw more cards, empty her vanguard's soul, and subsequently gain benefits from it.

It is then revealed that Leon's \"wind\" is actually the power of Psyqualia. In a Psyqualia-induced vision, Leon tells Aichi a tale from long ago about a conflict between the many clans on the planet Cray. This war was eventually resolved by the appearance of the dominating Aqua Force armada. In the human world, the Souryu family had control over the Aqua Force which was used to hold power over the seven seas. However, for unknown reasons, the Aqua Force clan disappeared, and so did the Souryu family's power. The last remaining Souryu members foretold a prophecy of a child who would be \"embraced by the wind\" and restore the family name and the Aqua Force clan to their former glory; Leon believes that child is himself. In a flash, Aichi is shown a vision of two Blue Storm Dragon, Maelstroms, which Leon claims to be his \"whirlwind\" image of victory. Back to the tag fight, Leon rides one Maelstrom and activates its Limit Break. But Aichi uses a perfect guard to block its attack and safely makes it to his next turn.

Then, Kamui says that his turn will be the last as he rides another Perfect Raizer, bringing its power up to full potential. However, the usually-mellow Sharlene easily blocks Kamui's attacks and grows angry with his indirect \"Final Turn\" declaration. On Leon's turn, he follows his \"wind\" and calls another Blue Storm Dragon, Maelstrom as a rear-guard, now having two Maelstroms as Aichi had seen through Psyqualia. Leon attacks him with his vanguard Maelstrom powered up via its Limit Break, and Kamui tries to tag guard for Aichi. However, Leon's drive check reveals a stand trigger, giving his vanguard Maelstrom enough power to penetrate Q4's defenses and win the match for Dreadnought. Shortly afterwards, the two teams argue over the value of losing. Leon asks Aichi about what is the path he takes, and Aichi is reminded to make his own path.

As the fight continues, Kourin antagonistically puts down Aichi by telling him to give up and how he's reached his limits. He proves her wrong and shows his determination when he rides Blond Ezel and activates its Limit Break to defeat her. Despite her harsh words, Kourin is actually glad that Aichi won. Then, the second match-up starts with Kamui against Suiko, who also uses an Angel Feather deck. Although Kamui takes some precaution by not dealing 4 damage to Suiko for fear of Limit Break, she nonetheless plays a card named Doctroid Micros, whose skill is used to purposely give herself 4 damage.

With its Limit Break, Rekka superior calls more Angel Feathers from her damage zone and pressures Misaki to use a lot of her cards to block against her attacks. The two then have a conversation about how it was Rekka who motivated Misaki to change her deck. Misaki further elaborates that she was hesitant on changing her deck because she thought it would also mean changing the memories associated with her first deck.

His reasons for doing so are to set the Aqua Force clan free (which was also captured by the same foe), restore the Souryu family to its former glory, and then rule the world. Leon's Psyqualia is amplified by the dark powers of the enemy and blows everyone away. Later, after being knocked unconscious, Q4 awakens and speaks with an injured Takuto, who gives more revelations. He discloses the name of the mysterious enemy: Void, an evil power of emptiness that is currently encompassing the majority of Cray and will make its way to Earth if not stopped. Takuto also states that he manipulated everyone's memories to make them forget about the past relating to the 3 sealed clans in order to introduce the new clans, Gold Paladin and Narukami, for Aichi, Kai, and Ren to later use and get stronger for this upcoming battle to free Cray. After Takuto restores everyone's rightful memories, Q4 leaves him to find and confront Leon, who is currently allowing himself to be engulfed by Void's power. Resolute on saving Blaster Blade after remembering all that the card has done for him, Aichi receives a card that contains Blaster Blade's spirit, which aids the group in their search for Leon. Then, Q4 runs into Team SIT Genius' leader Chris attacking his comrades Lee and Ali. Falling under the negative influence of Psyqualia which is magnified by Void, Chris' obsession with being \"number one\" makes him go mad with power and prevents Q4 from going any further. To save Chris from what he once had undergone, Aichi engages him in a cardfight.",

The two easily beat all of the challengers, but then Naoki steps up to play against Kourin with honest feelings of wanting to join the club. With a new Jewel Knight Royal Paladin deck, Kourin battles Naoki, who uses the Eradicator Narukami trial deck he bought a while ago. In the middle of the fight, Naoki reveals that he knew Aichi from when he was in the elementary school division of Miyaji Academy and how he felt guilty for not doing anything to help Aichi who was being bullied at the time. Naoki further explains that seeing how much Aichi has changed because of Vanguard motivated him to find something to be passionate about and ultimately change himself. In the end, Naoki defeats Kourin with the Break Ride ability of Eradicator, Vowing Sword Dragon. With that, Naoki is initiated into the newly-formed Cardfight Club, and Aichi's life in high school truly begins.",

Later, Naoki asks Ikki's motive for challenging the Cardfight Club, to which he answers that while he was bribed by the student council with a bigger budget for the football team, he mainly did it for the sake of playing against a strong cardfighter like Aichi. The Vipers then take their leave, and the Cardfight Club is more motivated to find a fifth member to have the club become official before the student council acts again.",

          "SummaryEnglish": "The Cardfight Club receives an invitation to and then registers for the upcoming Vanguard Fight High School Championship, a tournament that will feature high school Vanguard teams from all over Japan. Naoki suggests to check out some of the competition, which leads to the club visiting Fukuhara High, an elite private high school that is associated with Team Asteroid. The club is greeted by Tetsu Shinjou, who leads everyone into the school where they watch a cardfight between Asaka Narumi and Leon Soryu, much to Aichi's surprise. Asaka tries to end the game by using Starlight Melody Tamer, Farah's Personablast and the Pale Moon strategy of superior calling units from the soul during the battle phase for additional attacks. Despite the multi-pronged assault, Leon defends himself and then rides Last Card, Revonn on top of Blue Flight Dragon, Trans-core Dragon. This activates the latter's Break Ride effect, forcing Asaka to discard a card from her hand. He then utilizes the Limit Break of Revonn to gain more power and critical value. Also getting a heal trigger, Leon plows through Asaka's defenses for a comeback victory. Afterwards, Leon gets reacquainted with Aichi, telling him that he and Team Dreadnought are now enrolled in a high school at Hong Kong; they have also been invited to participate in Japan's VF High School Championship. Then, Tetsu offers someone from the Miyaji Cardfight Club for a match. Ever eager to play, Naoki accepts, and Tetsu arranges for his opponent to be Ultra Rare's Suiko Tatsunagi, who is revealed to be a student of Fukuhara High. But when Naoki comments that Suiko's sailor uniform does not suit her, she gets peeved as the two begin their battle.",

          "SummaryEnglish": "After Naoki makes another offhand comment towards Suiko, the two start their cardfight. Suiko criticizes Naoki for being a good but uninteresting fighter. He tries to prove her wrong when he activates the Limit Break of his new ace card: Armor Break Dragon. At the cost of discarding three cards from his hand, Naoki not only eliminates Suiko's front-row rear-guard units, but he also increases Armor Break Dragon's power and critical value to unbelievable heights. Despite this, Suiko defends against Naoki's attacks with almost all of the cards in her hand. On the following turn, Suiko wins the game with Chief Nurse, Shamsiel by moving cards to and from her damage zone thus increasing most of her units' power. Afterwards, Naoki apologizes to his friends for his loss and realizes how weak he actually is. Shingo cheers him up (although with some harsh choice of words) and says that he'll train Naoki to become stronger. Then, Ren Suzugamori appears and is revealed to be the captain of Fukuhara High's Vanguard Club. Ren suggests to have a match with Aichi, showing him a glimpse of his reversioned Shadow Paladin deck. But this turns out to be a tease from Ren, who retracts his match request and dismisses everyone. As the Miyaji Cardfight Club and Team Dreadnought leave Fukuhara High, Leon tells Aichi that if he wants to fight Dreadnought at the VF High School Championship, then he will have to first defeat Fukuhara High at the regional qualifying tournament.",

The student council hopes to use this chance to embarass the club and tarnish its reputation. Despite the daunting task, the club decides to do a stage play using one of Shingo's prewritten scripts and with costume help from Emi and Mai. The script is loosely based on The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter but with Vanguard units; Aichi is given the role of the bamboo cutter (Little Sage, Marron), Misaki is the heroine (CEO Amaterasu), Naoki is the villain (Eradicator, Vowing Sword Dragon), and Kourin is the hero (King of Knights, Alfred). Although Kourin is seemingly busy with her job as an idol, Misaki notices that she is in fact preparing for the play. However, on the day of rehearsal, Kourin does not show up, which leads the club (except Misaki) to think that she is not serious about the play and that Aichi should take the role of Alfred. The day of the School Festival finally arrives, and all of Aichi's friends have come. Unfortunately, Kourin is not at school. To make matters worse, the club is informed by Suwabe that the club's time of performance is actually an hour earlier than scheduled. As the club hastily sets up for the play, Misaki learns from Akari why Kourin did not show up for rehearsal. The play then goes underway with Shingo narrating the story. But when the time comes for Kourin's scene, Naoki accidentally destroys the set and his costume, causing the audience to grow angry. Before the play is totally ruined, Kourin appears in her costume and saves the show when she declares a new adversary for her to face: the legendary fighter Daigo.",

Although Kourin applies a lot of pressure to him shortly into the fight, Daigo eventually gets a heal trigger and deals 5 damage to her, putting her in a tough situation. However, she is cheered on by Misaki and subsequently the audience to not give up. Kourin regains her composure and tries to end the game with the Limit Break of Leading Jewel Knight, Salome. Unfortunately, she does not do so. Daigo then uses White Dragon Knight, Pendragon's Limit Break to superior ride his new ace: Sanctuary Guard Dragon. He activates its Limit Break to overpower and defeat Kourin. Although the hero Kourin loses, Misaki, Aichi, Naoki, and Shingo all step up to challenge Daigo for their fallen friend. Daigo fakes being weakened by the club's strong bonds of friendship and then takes his leave. With that, the play ends with a happy ending and a round of applause from the audience. Aichi expresses his thanks for Daigo as a montage of Misaki's pictures (taken by Shin) during the play is shown.",

The first round pits Miyaji Academy against Hitsue High in a best-of-3 match. In the first game, Kai defeats Shingo, which puts Hitsue up 1-0. The second game features Miwa vs. Misaki. For the sake of his teammates, the typically-carefree Miwa goes all out with the Limit Break of Hellfire Seal Dragon, Blockade Inferno to retire all of Misaki's grade 2 rear-guards and gain a significant amount of power. Misaki completely defends herself, but she is left with a weakened battle formation. Nonetheless, on her next turn, Misaki rides Goddess of Good Luck, Fortuna and reassembles her forces. She also activates Fortuna's Limit Break to perform three drive checks and manages to get two drive triggers to increase her overall power, ultimately winning the game and tying the score 1-1.

          "SummaryEnglish": "After the end of the Link Joker incident and having an ominous dream, Kai goes to Card Capital. However, when he asks Shin and Emi about Aichi, neither of them remember Aichi or know who he is. Furthermore, when Kai goes to Miyaji Academy to ask Misaki if she remembers Aichi (to no avail), he also learns that the Miyaji Cardfight Club is gone, or rather it never existed at all. It is as if Aichi's existence has been completely erased. Kai goes to the room where the club would always meet and laments about Aichi but then remembers the Blaster Blade card. Suddenly, a Royal Paladin deck containing a new version of Blaster Blade appears before Kai. As he exits Miyaji Academy, Naoki stops him. As if reverting to his former self prior to meeting Aichi and playing Vanguard, Naoki asks about Kai's deck, which he responds by saying it is a Vanguard deck. Naoki shows slight signs of recalling everything, so Kai decides to play against him to jog his memory. Kai and Naoki return to Card Capital where Misaki gives Naoki a Narukami trial deck to use for their fight. Kai goes over the rules of Vanguard with Naoki as they play. When Kai uses Blaster Blade Seeker, it triggers Naoki's memory, which helps him remember everything including Aichi. Forming a new friendship, Kai and Naoki make a vow to find Aichi. Misaki notes that their fight remains unfinished, but Naoki loses his motivation to keep playing after what just happened. So, Kai asks Misaki if she wants to fight (after noticing Misaki's intrigued look at Blaster Blade Seeker and showing hints of remembering Aichi), and she accepts. In a post-credits scene, Aichi is seen sitting on a throne elsewhere...",

Even with her perfect memory, Misaki cannot seem to recall him. In a final attempt to make her remember, Kai performs Legion, an ability that not only returns cards from the drop zone into the deck, but it also summons a specific unit from the deck and places it next to the vanguard, thus allowing those two units to combine their powers and fight as one. Through this move, he calls forth Blaster Blade Seeker, which serves as the trigger to help Misaki regain her memories of everything related to Aichi. After Kai defeats Misaki, they and Naoki pledge to each other to find Aichi. However, unbeknownst to them, there are enemies who intend to stop them from doing so...",

At Miyaji Academy, in the room where the Cardfight Club used to meet, Naoki awakes from a nightmare in which he tries to reach Aichi but fails to do so. He then comes across Shingo, who has also forgotten about Aichi. Naoki tries to help him remember, but the two are suddenly approached by a mysterious steward named Moress Pennyworth. He has been sent by the enemy to stop those who are trying to find Aichi, with Naoki set in his sights. The cardfight between Naoki and Moress ensues while Shingo observes. While using his Megacolony deck to paralyze Naoki's units from standing, Moress tries to demoralize Naoki from continuing the search for Aichi. Naoki almost gives in to despair, but with encouragement from Shingo (who slightly regains his memories) and recalling Kai's words of working together, he recovers his fighting spirit and defeats Moress with a Legion attack. Naoki pressures Moress into telling everything he knows, but he manages to escape. Some time later, Naoki tells Misaki of this incident. Meanwhile, Kai pays a visit to Ren at Team Asteroid headquarters.",

However, Gaillard reveals that he is one of the Quatre Knights and tells Kai to stop his search for Aichi, but he refuses. Gaillard uses his mystical powers to create a separate dimension surrounded by blue flames called the Holy Prominence Prison in which he and Kai cardfight. Kai is surprised to see Gaillard using Aichi's Gold Paladin deck, and Gaillard responds by saying he has inherited Aichi's will.

Tokoha later learns and is distraught from the news that Akane has taken a post overseas and will be leaving Japan tomorrow. The next day, during the children's Vanguard tournament, Tokoha resolves to see Akane at the airport and have one more cardfight with her as a farewell gift. As they both recall their memories from the past, Akane reassures Tokoha that her departure is not the end but rather a new beginning. After Tokoha wins the fight, Akane gives her the present that she placed in the time capsule: a gold medal. Akane then leaves, and while on the plane, she opens the gift that Tokoha had left in the capsule: a special card of herself drawn by a young Tokoha.",

During the scuffle, Enishi tells Tokoha that Luna has become the new Peacemaker and has lost her sense of self as a result. Back at the villa, Ryuzu comes to realize that no matter what he says, Chrono will not join his cause. Just as Ryuzu lands the potential finishing blow, he summons his Chronofang Tiger to the real world and attacks Chrono with it. But it is at that moment when Chrono's 3 remaining Depend Cards awaken and are summoned to aid him. Chrono also summons Chrono Dran, and his four units fend off Tiger and knock out Ryuzu. This causes him to drop his other Depend Cards, which Chrono takes and tries to awaken all of them. However, doing so not only drains Chrono's energy and make him faint, but also unbeknownst to him, it worked in Ryuzu's favor. Later, after having an ominous dream about the Zodiac Time Beasts trapped with Luna, Chrono wakes up and finds himself back home safe with his friends and family.",

Als er es eines Tages nicht mehr aushält, nimmt er Reißaus – und begegnet Megumi Okura, die ihn sogleich in den Vergnügungspark Dreamland Wonder Hill einlädt.\n\nMegumi gehört zum Team Blackout, das sich in »Cardfight Vanguard!!« mit anderen Gegner duelliert. Dessen Anführer Danji Momoyama ist seit 20 Kämpfen ungeschlagen, doch nun steht ihm ein Duell gegen den mysteriösen Tohya Ebata bevor; der Verlauf dieses Kampfes erweckt auch in Yu-yu den Wunsch, in das Kartenspiel einzutauchen. Schon bald wird er Mitglied des Teams, aber ziemlich bald auch ins kalte Wasser geworfen. Kann sich der frisch gebackene Spieler bei seinen anstehenden Duellen gegen mitunter klar erfahrenere Gegner bewähren?",
