Suou's main rival, Soshizaki Midori, invites her to join up on the same team in high school, with a promise that she'll never let Suou \"play alone.\" It's an earnest offer, but the question is whether Suou will take her up on it. Thus the curtain opens on a story that collects an enormous cast of individual soccer-playing personalities!",
