  "SummaryEnglish": "Set in an alternative 1969 Japan, a special group of teenagers has been gathered together under a secret government operation known as Aegis, to fight an enemy trying to take over the earth... called simply, \"Invader\". The Invader can turn ordinary citizens into zombies under their control, and only the Aegis agents, called the Gatekeepers, have the special ability to open the \"Gate\" separating the Invader's dimension and our own, and be able to eradicate them. The show opens with ordinary high school student Ukiya Shun witnessing an Invader attack, and quickly realizing that he is one of those with special power, is indoctrinated into Aegis. Each agent has a different ability and method of attack, everything from magic arrows to hallucinogenic piano music! Also crucial to story is young Ruriko, an experienced member of Aegis who has to work hard to prove her worth after the obviously powerful Shun joins the team. To make matters worse, the two had gone to grade school together,",

Nearby, Miyu Manadzuru, another high schooler, avoids a pushy companion by ducking into an alley and flying into the sky. Ayane spots the flying girl in the night sky. At school the next day, Ayane is revealed to be a cynical loner, known as being into technology and labeled a weirdo. Meanwhile, an inspector looking into a car accident finds one of the trenchcoat-wearing figures in a wrecked man. The figure disappears, leaving a small crystal behind. Ayane meets with Nazo, a mysterious older man who tells her to seek out Miyu since Miyu's a Gate Keeper.

Ayane and Miyu are riding Ayane's scooter and on the vehicle's tail as well. Ayane opens the Gate of Illusion behind her to throw the police off the chase. Miyu uses the Gate of Flight to catch the truck, but she smacks into a highway sign instead. The next day Ayane complains to Reiji about Miyu's performance. He drives off and, stuck in a traffic jam, is attacked by Invaders. He eradicates many of them with his Black Gate and Gate of Foresight. The surviving Invaders flee. Reiji possesses great Gate powers, but each time he uses them it physically weakens him. As Miyu and Ayane talk at school, Miyu discovers Ayane's glasses are made of ordinary glass. They spot what seems to be a ghost. Following the ghost, Miyu and Ayane stumble across an elevator to an underground complex, the remains of the original Far East bran",

The woman, Saemi, invites Ayane to dinner with her and her child, Junichi. In Saemi's house, Saemi asks Ayane if she's forgiven her father. Ayane reveals she can't forgive her dad for leaving her and her mom. She tells Saemi she's met Yukino, the black-haired ghost girl Saemi told her about before. On the rooftop of the school, the blond ghost-girl appears before Yukino and taunts her for not being able to open a Gate anymore.

Suddenly, Satoka appears and reveals that Ayane is the only daughter of legendary Invader-hunter Shun Ukiya. Satoka asks why Ayane took her mother's maiden name, given her dad's achievements. Ayane slips away without answering, angering Satoka. Count Akuma Hakushaku, an Invader, tells the blonde ghost girl his strategy of luring victims with the smell of honey and then poisoning them. Satoka fruitlessly tries to find out about Ayane from Miu. After Satoka leaves, Yukino appears to Miu and quotes more cryptic poetry. Ayane visits Miu at her place of work and criticizes her for putting up a false, friendly front when she's actually being selfish. Reiji picks up Invader activity, and Satoka races to its location. Satoka slaughters the Invaders using her Gate of Blades. It looks like she's all done by the time Ayane arrives. Excited b",

Reiji has been taking care of Ayane, who's been in a coma for four weeks. Reiji talks about how Ayane hated the city, and how the city's corruption breeds Invaders. He shows Miu the storeroom of crystals from vanquished Invaders. He says that one day he hopes to be able to turn these crystals back into humans, even though the chances are slim. He also wonders why, despite her hate, Ayane continued to bring the crystals back to him instead of destroying them. The blonde-haired Ghost Girl enters Headquarters and hovers over Ayane. She says Ayane is just like her. Reiji opens his Black Gate on her, but she isn't absorbed. He realizes she isn't an original Invader, but a human. Using her own Gate powers, the Ghost Girl blasts Headquarters apart, takes back all the collected crystals, and disappears. Reiji reveals that he's partly prosthetic because his use of Gate Powers consum",
