Panda works with the ham-ham girls and Hamtaro to put the flying plan into action. The male ham-hams, however, are very skeptical. They don't think hamsters will ever fly and so while Hamtaro makes his attempts, they just laugh and have snacks. After some initial failures, Hamtaro comes up with a revised plan. He decides to try using feathers and also manages to talk the male ham-hams into giving flying a try. He does so by explaining the possible benefits: quick escape from an attacking animal, or fast transportation, which ap",

She and her Mom are talking about how much time Dad has been spending at work lately. Just then, Dad comes in. They're hoping to spend some time with him. He says that he's tired, but can't stick around, as he has to get going back to work. He talks about corporate restructuring and how what's happening at his company is great, but the hours are long. He leaves and Laura's Mom complains that they're working him to a \"\"frazzle.\"\" She says it isn't fair. Hamtaro takes the problem to the clubhouse. He thinks that if the ham-hams pitch in to help Laura's Dad, he could finish his work faster. Howdy's not really sure what work is and Dexter says that it's what humans do to buy groceries. Maxwell says that he'll do some research on work. Hamtaro tells the ham-hams to get a good sleep because they're going to work tomorrow. The next day, the ham-hams are all wondering where to go.

She explains to Hamtaro that at school they're having a fire and earthquake drill and so she figures they should practice at home. Hamtaro's a bit confused, as he doesn't understand the concept of a \"\"fire drill\"\" and so he comments that he thought kids were supposed to stay away from fire and drills. He gets to thinking that a fire drill is a drill that shoots fire, which you can use when there's an earthquake. He heads to the clubhouse to talk about it. There's some more discussion about what it could possibly be, before Maxwell finally explains it. Boss snippily asks him if he found the definition in one of his books. Maxwell says that it's important to be prepared in an emergency, so that you don't panic when one happens. Hamtaro thinks this is all interesting, altho",

Laura, half believing, sets her mind on standing by Travis when her class goes to see the stars so that they can make a wish on a star together. Hamtaro is confused about this Milky stuff in the sky, reports to the Ham-Hams that Laura is about to go way far away to make a wish on a star with Travis. At all costs, the Ham-Hams set out to keep Travis away from Laura so that she cannot go with him to wish on a star.
