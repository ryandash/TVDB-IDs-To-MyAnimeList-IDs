          "SummaryEnglish": "The euphoric homeostasis our protagonist Akiha enjoys while eating her breakfast is shattered when she has explained to her Kazane's marriage volition. Nami's derisive remark and Kazane having created several designs for the wedding gown prompts Akiha to recruit Imoko into her plans to vote with her feet. Galvanized by the prospect of an amplified allowance, Nami gives chase and tries to scare capitulation into Akiha only to find that Imoko has already steered for the space port where Akiha finds that she cannot board the transport due to not having her student card, a minor but unexpected setback that stops the agoraphobic Nami in her tracks. Imoko and Akiha drive to the school with two of Akiha's classmates, one of which secures an escape pod for Akiha which she and Imoko avail after school only to be caught in the midst of a gravity quake, a gravity quake caused by the brain colony Leopard phasing in from hyperspace. Ahika exploring around on Leopard before meeting the AI entity face-to-face sets the stage for a frenzied Othello sequence that introduces Itsuki Kannagi (who tries to arrest both Akiha and Leopard), the QT-Arms Starsylph (which Akiha uses to arrest Leopard's ballistic plummet with Itsuki's guidance), and Honoka Kawai (who seems to have been awaiting Akiha's arrival along with Akiha's other siblings Takane and Sakura.",

Nami teases Akiha before running into Kazane who (after ordering Nami to her room) offers her apologies for the adverse side effects of her actions. It seems that the Student Council president wants to confront Akiha for her earlier adventure in the escape pod, a volition with which Honoka violently disagrees as she introduces herself in earnest. While Itsuki and Nina compute their next move regarding Leopard with UL, Honoka abducts Akiha and explains that she has an important role to fulfill for Leopard before leading her through equipping and defining the Q-TECTOR as the two set off on their first mission, replacing the magnetic chamber to Leopard's antimatter cannon. While Akiha grapples with the ethics, Honoka simply orders Wygar to destroy whatever precludes their travel path not caring that she brings the ICP into the mix by doing so. Directing that Akiha proceed on ahead, Honoka challenges Itsuki who soundly defeats her before confronting Akiha who is just about to emancipate the Golden Orb for transport, that is, if a clear trajectory can first be entreated of the newly-arrived Nervalist annelid.",

          "SummaryEnglish": "Wrapping itself around the Golden Orb, the Nervalist annelid wastes no time initiating its \"This stays right here, interlopers!\" attack. Honoka capitalizes upon Itsuki's decoy act and successfully wounds the annelid before helping Akiha transport the Golden Orb to Leopard in spite of Itsuki's injunction. Seeing the Nervalist annelid refuse to accept defeat as it orders the whole facility to give chase, Honoka stays behind and directs Akiha on ahead whose computations on interpreting the circumstances quickly takes a back seat to the converging ICP. The Golden Orb now in place, Leopard prepares to discharge his Golden Soul Shout; an effulgent explosion later, Leopard celebrating his victory with a haiku prompts Imoko to savagely remonstrate the AI entity and Akiha to repudiate Leopard much to Honoka's anguish. Meanwhile, Itsuki's decision to take matters into her own hands in spite of being read the riot act inspires the ICP powers-that-be to charge Bougainvillea and Mintao Itsuki's capture, the first attempt thereof blowing up in their face thanks to Itsuki's supervisor Nina. Even with her undercover alias Mutsumi Shimoyama, Itsuki demonstrates several times that she needs to be polished in several areas. Unfortunately, Honoka still sees the entire ICP as her enemy and decides to confront Itsuki by first luring her to the roof for a one-on-one duel. Shocked at the temerity behind Honoka's absolute neutrality injunction considering the damage caused thus far, Akiha intercedes with a \"Stop this at once!\" smack to both Honoka and Itsuki.",

While Itsuki is cautioned about Bougainvillea and Mintao, Leopard's web-surfing on her computer incenses Akiha enough to confront the AI and declare her autonomy only to have the mission objective reaffirmed, acquiring the Positron Matrix, before being sent on her way with Imoko. Meanwhile, Itsuki is summoned when a psychotic Nervalist iconoclast decides to wreak havoc only to find that she cannot even defend herself, never mind attacking him. Several members of the Student Council combining efforts with Honoka to stalemate and eventually neutralize the assailant sets the stage for a sequence that explains the common prologue both Honoka and Itsuki share with the Nervalists and the X-QT race, the latter having a near-complete computation crash as she tries to interpret all she has experienced while the ICP deals with the aftermath. Leopard reads Akiha finding the Positron Matrix right when Itsuki arrests her as the perfect opportunity to humble Akiha's recalcitrance by phasing away parts of her Q-TECTOR. Unfortunately, since Itsuki is in the same boat, that forces an armistice as Akiha and Itsuki collaborate to evacuate with some of their dignity and modesty unaware that Honoka has already successfully acquired the mission objective.",

Her anger at Leopard gone, Akiha sets to her daily school life and appears to be much happier. Honoka approaches Akiha with an entreaty to reconsider her repudiation that suggests that she has no independent human volition as she relays Akiha's inquiry of why Leopard chose her. Sakura introducing herself in earnest through a payload she sent to the Shishido family gives way to Itsuki delivering a \"To the colony, or else!\" gunpoint nudge that places them before Bougainvillea and Mintao who are charged Itsuki's apprehension. The deus ex machina comes when Leopard manifests himself and Honoka enters the fight to assist Itsuki.

UL quickly locates the group's destination but accidentally instigates a prison riot that brings Bougainvillea and Mintao into the mix. While Akiha tries to swim out of the stampeding prisoners, Itsuki and Honoka encounter Sakura's personal bodyguard that wishes to befriend the pair; a brief but fierce battle gives way to an encounter with the charming and affectionate Sakura. Akiha rejoins the group in time for a video feed depicting Takane as Aleida's prisoner and rushes off to the rescue with Honoka and Itsuki right on her heels.

Bougainvillea and Mintao intercept Itsuki only to get caught up in Nerval deep-freezing Leopard. While Kazane is appointed alpha administrator and given Morihime, Akiha and Honoka fare no better as they rush to the rescue. Nerval and Aleida accosting the group drives Honoka into a frenzy that inspires Takane to intercede. A big hullabaloo breaks out whose deus ex machina comes when Sakura reasons that sunlight can emancipate Leopard from his icy prison. Kazane and Takane's combined intercession paves the way for Akiha to finish off Nerval. Unfortunately, Xanthippe phases in to carry off Nerval who vows vengeance at next engagement. Akiha's bewilderment at the recent events nearly becomes a comprehensive cerebral computation crash when Kazane and Elle explain that she was born into a family whose role in constructing Nerval and all the brain colonies that came thereafter includes being charged military vigilance thereof -- in this case, against Nerval.",

As Sakura has demonstrated for her, Leopard is not thrilled with having company disrupt his computation of Nerval and Xanthippe's next move and the necessary countermeasures thereof -- especially if that company wishes to add a woman's touch like Kazane and Takane. While bathing in the hot spring, Kazane explaining the prologue of the Shishido family and the brain colonies like Leopard gives way to a Crocodilas leaping onto the scene to steal the Golden Orb's cooling system and the research adventure in the library defined by a knight that is none too thrilled to have visitors. Itsuki inhibits the knight long enough to discern its volition and define the group as its allies; after a protracted messy search, the requisite map is in hand and the chase continues. It seems that the Crocodilas took the cooling system to avail as a plaything for its child relatives; while a gentle explanation is enough to retrieve the stolen cooling system, it does not keep Bougainvillea and Mintao from getting read the riot act for their damaged QT-Arms and their unsuccessful capture of Itsuki.",

Itsuki is able to stalemate Akiha at her first confrontation due to the structural damage accumulated by the latter reaching critical mass. While Akiha's prologue is explained prior to the doctor's arrival, Itsuki approaches the baseball demon Leopard for his instruction which comes at a high price.

While Honoka and Akiha change course to Leopard who is not thrilled with Sakura's attempts to entertain herself at his expense, it seems that there is something rotten in the Surre Academy Student Council as Aleida introduces Tsutsuji Baba to the AI entity Benkei along with there being quite a prologue between Aleida and Tsutsuji. As Benkei explains the Bisner Plan to Tsutsuji, Kazane manifests her displeasure at Akiha skipping school by lashing out at Nami who is incensed at being kept out of the loop with a stern \"Stop whining and grow up already!\" tirade before she and Takane make their exit. While out and about, Nami has a psychotic nervous breakdown related to her prologue as a model along with the anguish of being estranged from her family that sets the stage for her defection to Nerval whose volition for her is similar to that of Leopard for Akiha.

Tsutsuji's declaration of war against fate (aka Akiha herself) gives way to Itsuki joining the battle with Kazane's approval. Benkei encasing Leopard in an airtight matrix escalates matters to require the Leopard Cannon as well as the Absolute Break Through Control, both of which Benkei perverts to his advantage and Kirkwood's detriment. It seems that Tsutsuji initiating an energy signal that overrides autonomous human volition is part of Nerval's revenge from the St. Artemis battle, stalemating/subjugating Leopard, conquering the Shishido family, and arrogating Kirkwood. Furious at being wielded in Nerval's plans, Leopard recovers himself to push Benkei into a decaying orbit above Earth before ejecting himself. Takane, now a Nervalist vassal, wields her QT-ARMS to inhibit Akiha's collaborative efforts with Honoka and Itsuki to arrest Leopard's kamikaze plummet with Benkei.",

Tsutsuji's conclusion that Nerval is not coming to the rescue along with her subsequent decision to wield the indigenous tribe in a raid to capture Sakura's ship obfuscates the difficult time Kirkwood is having while Aleida continues her efforts to pollute Nami's computations so that she becomes the Nervalist \"girl who leaps through space\" of her own volition. Nina approaching Bougainvillea and Mintao who are moved to tears that she actually treats them like human beings while inviting them to join the Mysteries Division obfuscates Itsuki (who suspects that Friedrich knows more than he says) having it explained that the Pied Piper (the mysterious structure that appears to hypnotize people) is actually an orbital elevator for gathering people to become Nerval's colonists and have it demonstrated that the QT rose's primary purpose is as a defensive counter-measure. The Pied Piper successfully repulsed, Friedrich explains that he unplugged several components from Leopard for fear that he would betray humanity, the same components that Akiha and Honoka have been out and about retrieving. Akiha barely has a chance to ask the significance of the \"girl who leaps through spacee\" before Tsutsuji and Benkei make their move to hijack Sakura's ship only to learn that the Pied Piper orbital elevator more than meets their needs in this regard right as Nami is flown off to be empowered as a \"girl who leaps through space\".",

Bougainvillea and Mintao discovering the seriously-injured Elle while on patrol and Nina congratulating them obfuscates Akiha and the gang having the Terra Abduction demonstrated for them along with Xanthippe phasing in from hyperspace to greet Aleida prior to collecting the newly-captured prisoners from Pied Piper. Sakura spotting Nami sends Akiha into a mad dash to her QT-Arms for some answers with Itsuki and Honoka right on her heels . . . just in time to see Nami reaching for the mystical staff Aleida is offering. Akiha exhorts Nami's company only to find that Nami's computations are thoroughly polluted and that she is Nami's alpha vendetta. While the Existence octet bootstrap themselves for battle, Itsuki and Honoka arrive to learn Aleida's real identity and that Nami has repudiated the entire Shishido family. Sakura slicing at Xanthippe's hull disrupts Nami's preparation to finish off Akiha who makes a hasty retreat. After ordering the Existence octet to effect a cerebral crash on Leopard, Nami and Aleida board Xanthippe as she phases into hyperspace to Akiha's anguish .",

Emilio leads the Student Council through smuggling themselves out of the school -- and right into a confrontation with a Nervalist automaton that promptly gives chase with several of its brethern. The ICP facilitating the evacuation only to find themselves the vendetta of the Remote Attackers obfuscates Nerval having a housekeeping conference with his subordinates while in an anthropoid form prior to Xanthippe's arrival with Nami and Aleida. While the missing-in-action Kazane is shown safe and sound on the Moon with Morihime listening in on the aftermath of Nerval's political maneuvering, Nami meeting Nerval for the first time turns out to be quite an adventure. While Nami and Nerval reconcile their expectations of each other to reality, Akiha recovers herself and is shocked to find that her reckless attempt to chase Nami has gotten her thrown into orbit around Jupiter much to her shock. UL's tabulation of an estimated travel time back to Kirkwood of five years and the oxygen supply lasting ten years gives way to a triangular argument that is only disrupted by Tsutsuji and Benkei's hijacking attempt along with Sakura discovering both the Leopard and Benkei Colonies intact. After Leopard is installed back in his colony body, Honoka and Itsuki seclude themselves to sort out their feelings while Leopard angers Akiha with the misogynist accusation of inevitable treachery »inherent« to the Shishido family -- right until the advent of a mysterious electrical storm within the colony . . .",

Sakura's scarf and hat reveals itself as an alien named Yupitan, and suggests using the Benkei colony (which is still attacked to Leopard's colony as a result of their fight) to provide the additional acceleration needed to escape from Jupiter's gravity well. With help from Tsutsuji and the QT-Arms, the plan is successful, and they come across an abandoned space station. Yupitan tells them it was the old base of the Shishido family when they were fighting Nerval, and they discover that the energy stored there will allow them to hyperjump back to Kirkwood. However, Loepard refuses to hyperjump, so they get Benkei to do it instead. At the refugees, Bou and Min are assigned to help infiltrate Surre Academy, but they see Nami brutally force one of the students into a box and run away, leading the Nervalist forces to the refugees. As Nami leads an assault on them, Leopard and Benkei suddenly appear.",
