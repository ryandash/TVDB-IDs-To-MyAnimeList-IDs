With a rumored mole in the ATF and good guys getting killed left and right, Bill and the Gunsmith Cats are forced to work underground. Working off of a tip they got from Washington, the Cats locate one of the gunrunners' arms storage facilities, but things take a turn for the worse when the guards spot them. Bloody Pierce captures Minnie May and Rally has to race in reckless pursuit to rescue her best friend from being carved up by the sinister Russian.",

Can Bill and the Gunsmith Cats figure out who's really behind the gun running operation before the Bloody Pierce kills them all?",
