After the disappearance of his father, the Park family, who live happily in Pyongyang, are suddenly repatriated to the infamous political prisoner internment camp. In a fierce competition for survival, the main character, Johann, gradually loses his pure and tender heart and deceives others, while his mother and sister try to live ethically without losing their humanity. One day, losing his beloved family was a kick, and Johan began to explore the meaning of \"why people live\" at the edge of despair. Eventually, Johan's battle involves other prisoners, and a small revolutionary signal rises in the camp.",
