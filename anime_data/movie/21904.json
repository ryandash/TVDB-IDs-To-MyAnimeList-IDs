    "TitleEnglish": "Inuyasha the Movie 4: Fire on the Mystic Island",
    "SummaryEnglish": "In Horai Island, six half-demon children (Asagi, Dai, Roku, Moegi, Shion and Ai), watch a woman (resembling Kikyō) dropping a green orb to the Cauldron of Resonance. It frees the Four War Gods (Ryūra, Jūra, Kyōra and Gōra), and the scars appear on the rest of all children. Ai, not affected by the gods, leaves the island to meet up with Inuyasha and his friends. The heroes learn that Gōra used Kikyo's blood to create her doppelganger and Ryūra placed the scar on Inuyasha, though Inuyasha and the children cannot resist it. One man tells the story about the myth of the island, before Kikyō sets out to the island. As the rest of the villagers safely head to the shrine, Sesshomaru remembers the day he got the scar. Upon arriving at the island, Inuyasha and his friends are ambushed by Jūra. While Miroku and Sango manage to distract Jūra, Inuyasha saves Kagome and Ai from Ryūra.",
