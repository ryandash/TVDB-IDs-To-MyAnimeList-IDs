        "eng": "In mid 15th-century Japan, flood, drought and famine transformed the landscape of Kyoto into a barren wasteland. More than 80,000 people perished between 1459 and 1461. This desolate state serves as the backdrop to the beginning of the country's greatest civil war. In this era, a boy is born to a starving and impoverished woman who abandons him. Eight years later, the boy has become a beast and wanders the countryside surviving in the wild with his axe. In desperation, he kills and eats humans as well. He attacks a Buddhism, but the monk easily defends himself. The monk provides temporary food and shelter, and names the boy Asura. He teaches Asura a Buddhist chant hoping one day he would understand it. After a while, he leaves the boy on the side of the road and continues his travels.",
