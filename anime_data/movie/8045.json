        "eng": "In the East Blue, the pirate El Drago and his crew are searching for the treasure left behind by the legendary \"Great Gold Pirate\" Woonan, which is said to be a mountain of gold; El Drago eventually finds a treasure map to Woonan's gold by killing Woonan's former crew. While traveling to the treasure, El Drago's men rob the Straw Hat Pirates, who have run out of food and are close to starving. Luffy attacks them and accidentally smashes their small boat in the process. El Drago retaliates using his Scream-Scream devil fruit powers, sending a powerful shock-wave that completely destroys the small boat and knocks the Going Merry away. Zoro dives into the sea to save Luffy, separating them from the rest of the Straw Hats, and finds Tobio, a small boy who was forced to work for El Drago. Smelling food, Luffy, Zoro and Tobio use the remains of the boat to travel to a floating oden shop run by Tobio's grandfather, Ganzo. Not having any cash, Luffy and Zoro accidentally perform an eat and run and are chained together by Ganzo.",
