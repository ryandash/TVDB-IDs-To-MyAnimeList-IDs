    "SummaryEnglish": "The story of Princess Aurora and the evil curse placed on her by vengeful fairy Maleficent. According to prophecy, Aurora will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and fall into a deep slumber on her 16th birthday, from which only the kiss of her true love can awaken her. Three doting fairies – Flora, Fauna and Merryweather – pose as peasant women to raise the young princess, whom they call Briar Rose, and live deep in the forest where Maleficent cannot find her. One day while riding in the woods, Prince Phillip catches sight of Briar Rose and the two fall in love at first sight. But Rose learns from the fairies that she is a princess and must return to the castle immediately to fulfill her royal duties. There, Maleficent discovers Aurora alone in the tower. The prince rushes to the castle to rescue Aurora, but first he must battle Maleficent, who assumes the form of a fierce, fire-spouting dragon.",
