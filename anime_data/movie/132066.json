    "SummaryEnglish": "Chi was born in Taiwan on April 5, 1979, the day the Chiang Kai-shek died, and so she grew up during a time when Taiwan slowly transformed from a single-party dictatorship to a democracy.[5] After immigrating to the United States, she receives news of her grandmother's death. When she returns to Taiwan for the funeral, memories from her childhood and adolescence return to her. As she reconnects family, friends, neighbors and acquaintances from her childhood, she begins to reflect on the nature of her unhappiness. As she reminisces about her childhood and the political backdrop of her upbringing, she sees how her native land has changed in her absence and reflects on how she had changed during that time as well.",
