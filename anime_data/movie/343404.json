At the museum, the trio meet its director, Asuka who is Akira's senior known as Himeya's legendary undine. The two of them are the successors to a gondola that has been carefully passed down since the founding of Himeya Company. However, Akira reveals that Aika, who is expected to inherit the gondola, has no intention of doing so. Azusa, who is not convinced, tries to find out why.",
