    "TitleEnglish": "Mr. Osomatsu",
    "SummaryEnglish": "The six children of the Matsuno family, Osomatsu, Karamatsu, Choromatsu, Ichimatsu, Jyushimatsu, and Todomatsu do not get a regular job even after the age of 20, and they are virgin kusonito who bite their parents' shins. They live together under one roof while pulling their legs together. One day, his eldest son, Osomatsu, meets an old gentleman (CEO of Apricots, a large company with a market capitalization of several tens of trillion yen!). There is a crazy story about wanting to adopt a son who died in an accident and two Osomatsu melons. Five younger brothers who can't afford to run through. A bone-and-flesh battle broke out that kicked others down when he wanted to be adopted. In front of them, three people in black who create an atmosphere that seems to be super important appear, and the story goes in an unexpected direction. Who will be adopted and live the life of the winners?",
