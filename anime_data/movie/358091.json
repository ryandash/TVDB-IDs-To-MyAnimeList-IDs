        "eng": "In ancient times, Shen Gong and Gui Fu joined forces to imprison the Jiao Demon King, who wreaked havoc on the human world, at the confluence of rivers and seas. To restrain the powerful Jiao Demon King, Gui Fu sacrificed his physical body, transforming his essence into a spirit which was then infused into the magical device crafted by Shen Gong to imprison the demon king. After the War of the Gods ended, the Dark Qilin and the Little Jiao Dragon repeatedly tried to touch the imprisoning device in an attempt to release the Jiao Demon King. Upon Jiang Ziya's recommendation, the Jade Emperor decided to deploy Erlang Shen, the former God of War, to apprehend the Dark Qilin. However, during the capture, Erlang Shen found himself entangled in a massive and shocking conspiracy.",
