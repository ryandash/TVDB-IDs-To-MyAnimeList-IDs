    "TitleEnglish": "Rudolf the Black Cat",
    "SummaryEnglish": "Rudolf is a domestic little black cat from the little town of Gifu (region of Chubu, the center of Japan) who never left his home, being cared for by the child Rie, his owner. When Rie's mother asks her to visit his grandmother to take her food, Rudolf follows Rie out of the house in the wish to know the world outside the home. But when Rudolf runs afoul of a fishmonger, running away and gets inside a trailer of a truck, he's knocked out cold by a broom the fishmonger threw. When Rudolf wakes up and gets out from the trailer to explore, he meets \"Gottalot\", a big bobtailed street cat who lets Rudolf sleep under a temple. The next morning, Gottalot and Rudolf traverse the town, as Rudolf learns that Gottalot was given a lot of names by the people he encountered, but when he asks Gottalot if he was a pet cat, he leaves in a huff. Soon after, Rudolf encounters another cat by the name of Buchi with a habit of imitating martial arts moves and yelling \"Hyah\", who tells Rudolf that Gottalot was known as the Junk Tiger. He also tells Rudolf about a dangerous dog by the name of Devil. As Buchi offers to let Rudolf hang around his house, he explains Gottalot's fight against a Doberman, who threatens to tear his ear off if He returns. Buchi cuts the story short when He sees a beautiful Siamese cat and goes after Her, but says goodbye to Rudolf.",
