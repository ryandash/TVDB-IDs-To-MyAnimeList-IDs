    "TitleEnglish": "Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge",
    "SummaryEnglish": "In the film, Frieza's older brother Cooler (Dragon Ball) is introduced. It begins with a flashback to when Frieza destroyed the Saiyan (Dragon Ball) home world, Planet Vegeta. Cooler's ship soon picks up a Saiyan space pod on the radar. The pod, carrying a baby Saiyan named Kakarot, is shown to be heading towards Earth, but Cooler's henchmen believe it is an escape. Cooler lets the ship go, accounting that it's Frieza's naïveté, and responsibility. More than twenty years later, Kakarot, eventually renamed Goku because of his adoptive new life on Earth, transforms into a Super Saiyan and defeats Frieza on Planet Namek. Despite showing no compassion towards his brother, Cooler takes his Armored Squadron - Doore, Neiz, and Salza to Earth with the intention of killing Goku in order to reclaim his family's honor. His forces ambush Goku and his friends on a camping trip, and Goku is wounded when he takes a blast from Cooler that was intended for Son Gohan (who has his regrown Saiyan tail).",
