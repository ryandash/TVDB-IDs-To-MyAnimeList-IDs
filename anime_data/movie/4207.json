    "SummaryEnglish": "In 1942, a 10-year-old named Timmy plays with a jigsaw puzzle of a nude woman when his unhinged mother walks in and chastises him for it. After she orders him to dispose of the puzzle, he returns with an axe and murders her, then saws her body with a hacksaw. When the police arrive, they find him hiding inside a closet and Timmy acts as if he was a witness of the crime scene. The police believe this, not suspecting him as the murderer, and is sent to live with his aunt. Forty years later, a black-clad figure opens a box containing the bloodied clothing and a photograph of Timmy's mother. He also unboxes the bloodied jigsaw puzzle and starts to put it together.",
