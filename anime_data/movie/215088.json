    "SummaryEnglish": "For Hemi, a boyfriend in a protective suit would be an easy thing to deal with compared to her own problem: she's in love with a Coffee Vending machine! Of course, it all makes perfect sense once you realize that he's actually an ancient Samurai who wished to be reborn into an indestructible steel body. But it certainly makes the dates uncomfortable and somewhat prone to scalding!",
