        "eng": "Gohan, Krillin, Bulma and Oolong are spending a peaceful day camping, but that night, a huge fire breaks out in the nearby forest. Using their strength, Krillin and Gohan put out the fire and save the animals. The next day, the group find the Dragon Balls using the Dragon Radar, and summon the wish-granting Eternal Dragon, Shenron, to restore the forest. Afterwards, Gohan befriends a purple dragon which he and Krillin rescued from the forest's destruction by the fire and names him Icarus (Hire Dragon in the original Japanese version). Unbeknownst to the group, the fire was started by a space probe landing. The next morning, the space probe begins scouting the area and it is soon revealed that it was sent by a Saiyan, Turles, who has chosen the Earth to plant the Tree of Might. The Tree of Might absorbs the world’s energy, storing it in its fruit, and whoever eats it is granted godlike power.",
