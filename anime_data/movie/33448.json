Doraemon, along with Nobita, Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo enters the game and find themselves in a spaceship game to race. But in the end, Gian and Suneo shoots everyone down, returning Nobita, Doraemon, and Shizuka back to Nobita's room. While waiting for them to finish the game, Nobita asks Doraemon for another gadget, which he uses the Gravity modifier gadget, making the entire room have no gravitational pull. Nobita accidentally farts, sending him flying all over the room and causing his mother to get to his room. When she suddenly got affected by the anti gravity, she accidentally kicks a tray that breaks the room's window, causing a great vacuum of air to flow out of the room. The space game got thrown out from the room, shutting down Gian and Suneo's spaceship, but not ejecting them from the game.",
