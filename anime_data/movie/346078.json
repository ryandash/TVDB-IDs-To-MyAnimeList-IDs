    "SummaryEnglish": "Koutarou, a novice editor for a web news, visits Komada Distillery for a project on Japanese craft whisky. Led by a young female president Rui who recently took over the family business, the distillery works hard to reproduce its signature whisky KOMA they had to stop making years ago. KOMA was a brand that Rui’s grandfather and father had lovingly preserved and a symbol of happiness for all. However, not to mention financial backing, too many clues are missing to revive the whisky once lost. Rui, Koutarou, and the distillery supporters pull together every thread to bring back the whisky filled with family memories.",
