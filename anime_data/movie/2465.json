        "eng": "100 years ago, the power of the List of Pokémon Hoopa was confined inside the Prison Bottle after it became destructive and out of control. In the present, Ash Ketchum and his friends, Pikachu, Serena, Clemont, and Bonnie are pulled through a portal created by Hoopa's interdimensional rings to Dahara City. Hoopa attempts to use its rings to transport everybody to the nearby Dahara Tower but it is revealed that, in its altered state, Hoopa cannot travel through the rings it creates. Baraz, one of Hoopa's caretakers and a descendant of the man who sealed off Hoopa's power, arrives with the Prison Bottle. The bottle possesses Baraz and makes him release a shadow of Hoopa created from the anger of being confined for 100 years. Hoopa's power is put back into the bottle.",
