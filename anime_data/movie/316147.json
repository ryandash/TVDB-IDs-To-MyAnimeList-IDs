Unbeknownst to her, it is all for a bet the drama-class senior Shin-Chun (by Dino Lee) makes with his friends. What started out as a prank slowly binds the unlikely pair together, and Nai-Yuan's life is never the same since then - Shin-Chun's best friend, Hsiu-Nan (by Bii), a music fanatic and also a dreamboat in the school, desperately tries to break them apart while his own pursuit of Man-Hsien (by Patricia Lin) doesn't go as planned. And bigger trouble awaits him as he finds himself frantically working through money issues. As the adolescent boys and girls grow through the coming-of-age story on loss and longing, their fantasies of love are to be tested.",
