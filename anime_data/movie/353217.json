    "TitleEnglish": "Bajie: Canopy Lower Realm",
    "SummaryEnglish": "As the first Chinese comic blockbuster with Zhu Bajie as the protagonist, it also focuses on using pen and ink to shape the character's growth and changes. Compared with the traditional Chinese comic heroes who were full of rebellious spirit in the past, Zhu Bajie has always been a character full of controversy and topics. Although he is greedy, lazy and selfish, he still has his own bottom line and persistence, which also makes him a warm man with flaws. This film also lays out the love line between Zhu Bajie and his first love, \"Second Sister Egg\" of Yunzhan Cave, Fuling Mountain, which makes Zhu Bajie's affectionate and righteous image more prominent. Although the \"beauty and the beast\"-like encounter is beautiful and short-lived, it is more... I want people to cry for their true love.",
