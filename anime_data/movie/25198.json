    "SummaryEnglish": "Vera (Neve Campbell) is a femme fatale for the 21st century: a beautiful, capricious young woman living in New York City who begins exploring the limits of her sexual and intellectual power. She picks up men on the street and has sex with them in her apartment. She also videotapes a sexual romp with a female lover, and has sexually frank discussions with her potential employer. As the daughter of wealthy, indulgent parents, Vera seems to be improvising her way through the beginning of her life as an adult.",
