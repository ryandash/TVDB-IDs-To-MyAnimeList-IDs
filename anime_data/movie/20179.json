        "eng": "Nobita Nobi and Doraemon experience the tale of Sinbad the Sailor of the ''Arabian Nights'' fame firsthand using a storybook gadget, but Nobita becomes bored by just watching it from afar. He tries to invite Shizuka Minamoto to enter the storybooks of other tales and accidentally brings Takeshi \"Gian\" Goda and Suneo Honekawa along. Gian and Suneo mess up the storybooks to create a \"fresh\" tale, which causes Nobita and Shizuka to experience a mishmash of various tales that Shizuka dislikes. Attempting to leave, she is knocked out by Sinbad's magic carpet and falls into the desert.",
