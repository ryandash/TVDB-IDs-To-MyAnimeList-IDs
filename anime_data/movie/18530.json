    "SummaryEnglish": "After the heroes seemingly defeat Naraku, Inuyasha, Kagome and Shippo are separated from Miroku and Sango. Kagura and Kanna meet Kaguya, the Princess of the Heavens, being sealed in a mirror. In exchange for freeing them, Kaguya promises them to grant their eternal freedom. When they take one of the five items, Kaguya is released from the mirror and she captures Kagome. The united group head and infiltrate the castle through the realm of mirrors. There, Kaguya attempts to transform Inuyasha into a full-fledged demon, but Kagome breaks the spell and saves Inuyasha. Naraku reappears on Kohaku's back, revealing that he faked his death. The villains escape from the realm. Kagome destroys the mirror and Inuyasha does to Kaguya's body. When Kaguya appears in a gas form, she is sucked into Miroku's wind tunnel. Inuyasha and his friends escape from the realm and return to their world through the mirror. With everything reverted to normal, they resume their journey.",
