    "SummaryEnglish": "(Note: The first two films are a compilation of the television series and the third film is an all-new story. Urobuchi Gen said that the third film's story coincidentally matches the lyrics to Kalafina's television ending theme song Magia if one examines them carefully.)\r\n\r\nMadoka used to be a normal girl living happily. This all ended when she sacrificed herself in order to save other magical girls from the utterly cruel fate that awaited them. Unable to let her memories of Madoka die, Homura continues to fight alone in the world that Madoka left behind for humanity in order to see her smile once more.",
