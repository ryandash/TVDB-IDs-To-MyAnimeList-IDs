The Strike Witches-a group of girls with extraordinary powers, formidable weapons, and advanced aircraft appendages-have made great strides against the Neuroi. But the war against them still rages on.\r\n\r\nYoshika Miyafuji was once a member of the Strike Witches and sacrificed the ability to use her powers in a major fight against the Neuroi. Unable to fight, she now wishes to pursue her dream of becoming a doctor and continue to help people. When new soldier and witch Shizuka Hattori comes to escort her to a prestigious European medical school, their journey becomes far more dangerous than originally planned. The Neuroi have changed, and their abilities are far stronger than before. Can the Strike Witches comes together once again to face their enemy? Or will they be able to without Yoshika's abilities?",
