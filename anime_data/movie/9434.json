    "TitleEnglish": "Godzilla: The Planet Eater",
    "SummaryEnglish": "Following the destruction of Mechagodzilla City, the remaining Bilusaludo on the Aratrum demand justice for Haruo destroying what they saw as necessary to defeat Godzilla. But the humans disagree, believing Haruo exposed the Bilusaludos' true intentions of assimilating Earth. The Bilusaludos revolt and shut down the Aratrum's engine room, forcing the ship to run on secondary batteries for the next two days. On Earth, Haruo learns from Dr. Martin that Yuko is rendered brain-dead with the Nanometal in her body keeping her alive. He also learned that those treated by the Houtua survived the nanometal's attempt to absorb them, with Methphies deceiving the survivors into believing their survival was divine intervention. Dr. Martin advises Haruo to hide until tensions ease.",
