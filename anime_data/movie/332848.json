    "SummaryEnglish": "In ancient times, Nuwa, who lived alone in the open field, made countless little people out of mud in order to relieve loneliness. The little people then turned into living women and men. They combined to reproduce offspring, and lived happily. Later, the god of fire and the god of water fought and fought, and the world was shaken for a while. As the battle between the two gods of fire and water escalated, even more terrifying things happened: the sky was knocked out of a crack by them, and the falling gravel smashed and injured many people who were fleeing for their lives.",
