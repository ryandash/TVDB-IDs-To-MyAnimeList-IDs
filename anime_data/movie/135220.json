    "SummaryEnglish": "Four friends live their adolescence between the highways and pastures at the margins of the city. Towards the end of their primary education, a question emerges: What will they do in the future? For them life bears no mystery. In a city that traps them between the mountains and train tracks, at a school where they learn nothing. The days go by, ignoring the projects they may have. They only wait for classes to end so they can hang out with friends, and face together their arrival to an unwanted destination.",
