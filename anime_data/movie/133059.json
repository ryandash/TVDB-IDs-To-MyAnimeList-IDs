    "SummaryEnglish": "The story shows how words and music can bridge the gap between Cherry, a boy who is terrible at communicating with other people; and Smile, a girl who hides behind a mask. They meet in a shopping plaza in a provincial city. Cherry always wears headphones and spills her emotions into her hobby, Japanese poems. For his part, Cherry always wears a mask as he is ashamed of his crooked front teeth, which are the reason he wears braces.",
