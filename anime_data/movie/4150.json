    "SummaryEnglish": "Septuagenarian best friends Fred Ballinger and Mick Boyle are on vacation in the Swiss Alps, staying at a luxury spa/resort in Davos Wiesen. Fred is a retired composer of classical music; at the hotel, he is approached by an emissary for Elizabeth II, conferring a knighthood and asking him to perform his popular piece \"Simple Song #3\" at Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh's birthday concert. Fred turns down the offer, claiming he is not interested in performing any more â€“ although he still composes pieces in his head when alone. Mick is a film director, and is working with a group of writers to develop the screenplay for his latest film, which he calls his \"testament\". Also with them is actor Jimmy Tree, who is researching for an upcoming role and frustrated that he is only remembered for his role as a robot. The hotel is inhabited by other quirky individuals, including a young masseuse, an overweight Diego Maradona, and Miss Universe.",
