    "SummaryEnglish": "Sam Alex (Prithviraj Sukumaran) is a police officer who is heavily dependent on alcoholism to ease the pain of his family loss. Sam was a romantic and peaceful family guy, leading a good life with his family. His loving wife Teena (Meghana Raj) and beloved daughter were murdered by his enemy right in front of his eyes, and as a result, he turns into an alcoholic. Sam's supervisor Aravindhaksha Menon (Vijayaraghavan (actor)) requests him to proceed with a parallel investigation in a case involving the disappearance and possible kidnapping of several young married men, since the present police team is not able to make any progress in the case. Sam refuses to this. Later, his mother Marykutty (Vanitha Krishnachandran) requests him to take up the investigation.",
