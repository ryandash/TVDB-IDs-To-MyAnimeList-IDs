        "eng": "The film begins during an exhibition match commemorating Ooarai Girls High School's victory in the 63rd ''sensha-dō'' tournament. After a lengthy battle, the joint team of Ooarai and Chi-Ha-Tan Academy is defeated by the combined St. Gloriana and Pravda team, largely due to the reckless charges by the Chi-Ha-Tan team. Upon returning to the Ooarai school carrier, Anzu informs the team that despite their victory in the tournament, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology will not honor their promise to keep the school open, claiming that it was just a verbal agreement with no legal standing. The school ship is then seized for decommissioning but with help from Saunders, the ''sensha-dō'' team manage to keep their tanks out of the government's hands.",
