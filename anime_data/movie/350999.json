    "SummaryEnglish": "Deeply touched by Mafuyu Sato's impressive voice, high school student Ritsuka Nakayama invited him to join him as a singer in his music group, alongside his friends Haruki Nakayama and Akihiko Kaji. With Mafuyu, Given's first concert was a real success, and also allowed Ritsuka to realize his feelings towards Mafuyu. After the two boys started dating, the young musicians' activities continued until they participated in a competition in which they did not win, but did not fail to attract the attention of many people. At the same time, Hiiragi Kashima, Mafuyu's childhood friend, and Shizusumi Yagi's group \"syh\", who notably won the competition in which Given failed, are preparing to make their debut. But due to the absence of its guitarist, the group finds itself blocked in its ascent. With his back against the wall, Hiiragi has only one solution: ask Ritsuka for help to temporarily assist them.",
