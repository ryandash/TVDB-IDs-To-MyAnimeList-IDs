    "SummaryEnglish": "The film begins ''in medias res'' with the space fortress ''SDF-1 Macross'' trying to evade the Zentradi at the edge of the Solar System. The ''Macross'' houses an entire city with tens of thousands of civilians who are cut off from Earth, after it had executed a space fold on the first day of the Earth/Zentradi war - taking the city section of South Ataria Island with it. During the latest assault, Valkyrie pilot Hikaru Ichijyo rescues pop idol Lynn Minmay (Macross), but are both trapped in a section of the fortress for days. Even after their eventual rescue, this fateful meeting leads to a relationship between the singer and her number one fan.",
