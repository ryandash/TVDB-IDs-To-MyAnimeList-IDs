    "SummaryEnglish": "Karthikeyan (Arjun Sarja) is a photographer-editor working in ''Indian Express''. Chitra (Meena (actress)) is a bank employee. Both reside in Navi Mumbai. Karthik meets Chitra while opening a bank account. While returning home, he again meets her in a train. He offers his seat, but she does not want to accept it. During a train strike, he invites her to travel in an auto to reduce expenses, but she declines. When Chitra hesitated to travel in the same train with Karthik, he became angry and explained that he talked to her because both are from the same locality, both are Tamilians, and he promises her that he will never talk to her anymore. After some days Chitra voluntarily talks to him. Karthik, in return, accompanies her to a police station to get back her snatched handbag. Karthik invites Chitra to his home to meet his parents.",
