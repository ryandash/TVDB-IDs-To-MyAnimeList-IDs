    "SummaryEnglish": "In a house on the Delta, in a silence interrupted only by the noise of the boats, a couple lives without crossing each other. He is a writer who waits for words; she is an alienated employee of the Exterminator House. The crisis of relationship (with the domestic, with the other, with writing, with the present) seems to endure in personal journeys, mixing loneliness and something hypnotic from this world. But an unexpected change in the course of one of them will change his life.",
