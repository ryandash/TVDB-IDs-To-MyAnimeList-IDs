    "SummaryEnglish": "Doron (Liron Levo) is a security operative sent to Lebanon with the mission to capture Manzur, one of the people in charge of the terrorist organization Hezbollah. He's promised that this will be his very last mission and that afterwards he will be left to build a family with his new wife. Fueled by this promise, Doron enters the town where his target is rumored to be hiding but soon discovers that it is filled with infected people intent on biting and spreading a strange new disease. Doron discovers Manzur's daughter Noelle (Yafit Shalev), who claims that her father had actually been working with Israel on a new biological weapon. Now Doron and the others must find a way to stay alive and get to safety.",
