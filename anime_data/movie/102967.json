    "SummaryEnglish": "When wealthy Arthur Patterson (Donald Moffat) finds out that he is dying, he tries to make peace with his past. He looks back to his World War II years, when he was a soldier in France. There, he met a poor French girl, Solange Bertrand (Kim Thomson), whom he fell in love with. Solange married his good friend Sam (Bruce Abbott), though, and they settled in New York City after the War, where Sam worked as an actor on Broadway theatre. Solange gave birth to three girls, who were all separated after the tragic deaths of their parents. Arthur is determined to reunite the girls, with the help of private detective John Chapman (Perry King). John warns the old man for a disappointing outcome, but Arthur remains determined to correct the past.",
