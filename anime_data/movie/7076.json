        "eng": "Afro spends his days making wooden sculptures of historical people and follows the rule of not killing anyone. When Jinno and Sio take both the headband and Rokutaro's mandible, they tell Afro that they will resurrect Rokutaro and use him for vengeance. Brother 3 is caught cheating at a dice game and tells Afro that Shichigoro has the Number 2 headband. After Afro saves Kotaro and Shichigoro thanks him for it, both men fight until Afro takes the headband and Kotaro sadly vows revenge. Afro destroys three cyborg warriors, who turned out to be Sio's relatives. Sio resurrects Rokutaro as a mindless killing robot. After strangling and seemingly killing Afro, Rokutaro kills Sio by impaling her through Jinno's body with a broken sword. Jinno's robotic body gives off an electrical surge through Sio's blood to revive Afro. After defeating Rokutaro, Afro retrieves the Number 1 headband. He gives the Number 2 headband to Kotaro and tells him that they will be ready to fight.",
