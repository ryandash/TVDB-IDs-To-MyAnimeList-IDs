Even though they have everything that they had ever wanted there, they return to San Francisco so Nick can focus on his career as a photographer and Ellie can give birth to their second child. Soon, life goes on a downward spiral for the high-powered, two-career couple, as Ellie is not satisfied in their surroundings. She misses her life as a doctor in Africa and suspects that Nick is not faithful to her when Scott's young and attractive assistant, Robin, arrives.
