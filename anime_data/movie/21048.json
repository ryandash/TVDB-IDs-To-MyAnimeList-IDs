        "eng": "Nobisuke watched a strange advertisement of a fantastic resort called Hotel Burikin on television at midnight. Sleepy as he was, he made a reservation even though he didn't even realize he was talking to the advertisement. The next day, when Nobita is upset because of the fact that his family never goes on a holiday trip, he discussed with the family their holiday plans, telling Nobita and Doraemon that he had made a reservation at Hotel Burikin. Excited, Nobita tells Gian, Suneo, and Shizuka about it. However, Nobisuke and Nobita's mom cannot find Hotel Burikin anywhere on earth, and started to think if Nobisuke is just dreaming about it, much to Nobita's horror.",
