The Mythical Pokémon Volcanion tries recovering Magearna, but has a band attached to its leg and is sent falling to a forest where Ash Ketchum and his friends, Pikachu, Serena, Clemont, and Bonnie are camping. Volcanion lands in Ash and friends' vicinity, and when they recover, Ash finds a second band attached to himself. Clement discovers the bands emit an electromagnetic force that binds Ash to Volcanion like a chain. Volcanion runs off, dragging Ash along with it.",
