    "TitleEnglish": "Uranus",
    "SummaryEnglish": "Bobby Vinton’s classic song Blue Velvet is about the enchanting gaze –––– how one loses himself in his lover’s eyes and body. It is the extreme form of beauty, consisting of erotism and lust. Uranus is Daniel Nolasco’s first installment of his “Gay Tour guide Rio” series, a masterful fusion of video, music, and the male body. It is considered one of the most iconic Brazilian queer short film.",
