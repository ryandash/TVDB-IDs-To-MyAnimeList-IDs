Nineteen years later Orine is on the run from the police when government agent Yuri offers an escape: a secretive mission to an experimental space-station orbiting earth. Orine enters the space-station to find her mother, Satomi, almost unchanged since her death almost 20 years ago. Unorthodox scientist Sensei explains Satomi was frozen at death and brought back to life using cyronics. Orine's orders are to shut down the space-station by planting explosives, but Satomi and Sensei attempt to convince her not to. Mother and daughter try to make up for lost time but the beautiful young fugitive must choose to destroy her mother, or save the world.",
