    "SummaryEnglish": "Nick Snowden, who is really the father of Santa Claus, falls for Sandy Brooks, a pretty zookeeper who works at the zoo from which he must rescue Buddy, a young reindeer who has not yet learned to fly. He needs her help to get Buddy out, so he follows her home. Nick meets Lorna, the landlord and owner of the boarding house where Sandy stays.  She thinks Nick is a tenant, gets to know him, and lets him stay in the boarding house.  Nick meets Hector, whose mother is a postal worker. Hector figures out that Nick is Santa Claus. Nick meets Sandy and falls for her. Sandy falls for him too and is unaware that he is Santa Claus. She helps Nick get Buddy out of the zoo and back to the North Pole.  Nick usually teleports himself in and out by mirror, but the only way the mirror works is by using North Pole snow. Buck Seger is a hunter who works at the zoo and has a crush on Sandy.  He sees Nick as a rival and researches that Buddy is from the North Pole.  He plans to sell Buddy.",
