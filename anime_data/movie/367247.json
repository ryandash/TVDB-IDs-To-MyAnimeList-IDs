But when a thief in Mikura Hall triggers an ancient curse, she’s left with no choice but to reclaim the stolen books herself…by entering the very stories she despises! With the help of the mysterious Mashiro, will she be able to restore her great-grandfather’s collection and save her town from a magical doom?",
