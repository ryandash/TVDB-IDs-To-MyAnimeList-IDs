        "eng": "Nobita requests Doraemon to give him the Doraemon#Dōgu and wishes for the world to become a place where the use of magic (paranormal) is possible. Witchcraft replaces science and technology and everyone makes use of it on their daily lives, except for Nobita, who, like usual, isn't very good at conjuring Spell (paranormal).
