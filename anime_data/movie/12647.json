Shao Jianbo, known by his codename Captain 203 after his unit, commands a group of 30 men.  They are out of food and low on ammunition. One of their problems is resolved when they defeat a group of bandits dressed as the PLA who are guarding stores of ammunition.  Reinforcements arrive via train in the form of Yang Zirong and Bai Ru, a combat medic, who are warmly greeted when they bring food.  Captain 203 leads his men to the village raided by the bandits.  Along the way, they meet a young boy who lost his family to bandit attacks.  Though he initially distrusts the PLA soldiers, he warms to them after they rescue him from a bandit spy in the village.",
