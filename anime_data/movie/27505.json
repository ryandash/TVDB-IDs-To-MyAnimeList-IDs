    "SummaryEnglish": "The movie is set against the marvellous city of Rome as Davide Marengo's crime story revolves around two main characters, a female thief, Leila (Mezzogiorno), whose modus operandi of looting her victims is by administering drugs or seducing them, and a lonely bus driver, Franz (Mastandrea), who is up to his neck in debt. The real story advances when the duo happens to come into possession of a valuable microchip valued at 4 million euros. The film's plot comes across more twists as a pair of hardened criminals, Garafano (Pannofino) and Diolaiti (Citran), and a retired intelligence officer, Carlo Matera (Fantastichini), enter the scene.<ref name=film4></ref>",
