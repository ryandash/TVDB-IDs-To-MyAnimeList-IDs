They are sent to stop the mysterious attacks on mining operations that have the governments of the world pointing fingers and blaming each other. While the pair bathe, Carson D. Carson, a former member of the group of smugglers they stopped on their last mission, interrupts their baths by falling through a vent. While Kei and Yuri get out of the bathtubs and question Carson, they are attacked by strange alien monsters that force the Angels to flee, leaving their equipment behind and wearing nothing but towels.",
