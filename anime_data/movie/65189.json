    "SummaryEnglish": "Despite doomsday warnings from throngs of locals, wealthy industrialist Robert Caine (Kirk Douglas) makes the controversial decision to build a nuclear power plant near a sacred cave in the Middle East. But before Caine can reap the benefits of his latest bid for global domination, he discovers that his son, Angel (Simon Ward), is the Antichrist, who is planning to use his father's project to trigger the end of the world.  As Caine digs deeper, a string of suspicious accidents occur that kill off prominent figures who criticized the project.  He also notes similarities between the design of the plant and features of a biblically-prophesied beast that will herald the apocalypse.  During a dream, Caine envisions the plant rising from the sea, then sees its circle of towers take on the form of a multiheaded monster.",
