    "SummaryEnglish": "Shiki uses his Devil Fruit powers to destroy marine ships and warn Monkey D. Garp and Fleet Admiral Sengoku. On a floating island, Monkey D. Luffy is chased by a genetically-enhanced animal. The monster is overpowered by the other monsters before Luffy defeats the fourth monster. The Straw Hats have been separated into three groups: List of One Piece characters#Sanji with List of One Piece characters#Usopp, List of One Piece characters#Roronoa Zoro with List of One Piece characters#Tony Tony Chopper, and List of One Piece characters#Nico Robin with List of One Piece characters#Franky and List of One Piece characters#Brook. Shiki tells List of One Piece characters#Nami that she has been taken to the island against her will and a brief flashback is shown: several days earlier, the Straw Hats read news of an attack on East Blue. Luffy vows to protect the East Blue before witnessing Shiki's ship overhead. After escaping a storm, Shiki meets Nami and reveals his powers to make any inanimate object he touches float. After learning it was Nami that delivered the warning, Shiki offers to take them there before abducting Nami. The others try to rescue her, but Shiki makes the pirates scatter on the island.",
