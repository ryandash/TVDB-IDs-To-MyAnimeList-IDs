      "SummaryEnglish": "Percival wohnte mit seinem Großvater Varghese allein auf God’s Finger, einem Hochplateau, das bis über die Wolken reicht. Dort führte der Knabe ein simples Leben, doch obwohl er es liebte, sehnte sich Percival doch heimlich nach Abenteuern. Ausgerechnet an seinem sechzehnten Geburtstag soll sich dieser Wunsch erfüllen, und zwar auf grausigste Art: Varghese war einst ein Heiliger Ritter in Camelot, aber als ausgerechnet sein Sohn Ironside einen schweren Verrat beging, verließ Varghese das Königreich, nahm seinen jungen Enkel mit und zog ihn allein auf. Nun erscheint Ironside vor den beiden und verletzt beide tödlich aufgrund einer Prophezeiung über die vier Apokalyptischen Ritter, die großes Unheil über das Königreich bringen sollen.",
