While Joey is still being confused by Apdnarg's moves, Leon Wilson wins his duel against Richard Goat. Meanwhile, outside of Kaiba Land, Weevil Underwood and Rex Raptor arrive and plan to sneak into the KC Grand Championship to face Yugi and Joey again. Back at the duel, Apdnarg reveals that everything he is done since his first move was to summon his next monster. Using the power of his Ancient cards, Apdnarg summons the Ancient Dragon. On the sidelines, Professor Hawkins explains that without the Ancient City, Stone Giant, two Stone Giant Tokens, Ancient Key, Ancient Tome, and Ancient Gate cards, you cannot summon the Ancient Dragon. He also explains that he and Solomon had a contest to see who could collect all the cards needed to summon the dragon first. Back at the duel, though the Ancient Dragon is powerful, Joey manages to destroy it with his Gilford the Lightning, but because of its special effect, it is able to revive because Ancient City was still on the field. Joey comes up with his own strategy, and manages to destroy both the Ancient Dragon and the Ancient City, leaving Apdnarg wide open for an attack. Joey directly attacks him, winning the duel. Everyone is stunned to see Joey actually winning the duel, but not as stunned as Joey when he finds out that Apdnarg is actually Solomon Muto.",
