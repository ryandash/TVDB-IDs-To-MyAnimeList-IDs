The producer, calling her Kuromi for short, gives her a tour of the offices, which are empty because most people have either quit, work from home or have nutty hours. And while she is coming to terms with this he collapses from a medley of stress related illnesses. Which in the opinion of the studio president is sort of impressive, because he did not think the guy would hold together long enough to pass this doomed project onto his replacement. Clearly it is going to be a long day.",
