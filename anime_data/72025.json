Ever curious and stubborn, Dubus convinces Plakia to help explore the ship. They soon come to realize that the ship may have been drifting in space for many years as soon as they reach the bridge. Instead of possibly an empty chair, the skeletal remains of an abh of royal descent (having some sort of jewel on it's forhead) is still sitting in the chair. They return to their own ship heading home to inform others of their findings. A few years later, a child is born unto Dubus and Plakia, Abriel Nei Dubrusk Paryunu Lafiel. They both agree not to reveal who Lafiel's mother is so she would wholeheartedly try to make her mother proud. Now is the beginning of Lafiel's adventure.

A deal struck by his president father left the elder Lin in charge of Martine and Jinto an Abh prince. The burden of royalty is an uneasy one for Jinto, who is unaccustomed to the stares his Abh uniform attracts. His friends also find it difficult dealing with nobility. Just one, Dorin Ku, shows up to see him off at the spaceport. Before walking away, Ku leaves Jinto with a gift, a baseball signed by all of his absent friends. The ball comes in handy a short while later when a young thief steals a traveler's luggage, but it's not because of Jinto's less-than-impeccable aim. Rather, it's Lafiel, his beautiful Abh escort, who stops the crime. But she's greeted with hatred despite her good deed. Is this the type of life awaiting Jinto? If so"

Even less uncomfortable than the trip to the vessel that will transport him to the Abh capital is the reception that awaits him once on board. Jinto is obviously unaccustomed to the fanfare that greets him, and is thrown for a loop when he learns Lafiel's true identity. He's not quite sure how to handle himself around a princess, which temporarily complicates the budding friendship. Friendship, however, may not be the only thing on Jinto's mind, as they quickly settle their differences and end up in his room discussing where Abh babies come from!

Lafiel would rather stay and fight, but Lexshue -- realizing the future importance of her stubborn protegee -- will hear nothing of it. The mood aboard Jinto and Lafiel's escape vessel is a somber one, as she laments her uselessness to the mission. Jinto does his best to cheer her up, but his efforts are futile.

Little do they know, but that lead will shrink significantly thanks to what was originally intended to be a very short layover for refueling in the Baron Febdash territory. Lafiel is quite uncomfortable with the excessive attention she receives from the baron's scantily clad vassals -- as well as with the lack of respect given to Jinto -- and seeks to leave immediately. Right on cue, Baron Febdash appears on a video screen, apologizing to Lafiel that his space station lacks the fuel her ship requires. Furthermore, he informs her that the vessel is in need of repair. Doubting the truthfulness of both statements, Lafiel is left wondering why Febdash seems to be trying to prevent Jinto and her from leaving. The intrigue only deepen"

However, she does learn a valuable piece of information: The baron's vassals are the key to finding her companion. Baron Febdash wasn't being untruthful when he told Lafiel over dinner that his father was entertaining Jinto, but he failed to mention that he kept his father confined, and that Jinto was his prisoner now as well.

Now left questioning the loyalty of all his vassals, Febdash is further incensed by a message that suddenly goes out over the intercom and by his inability to interrupt it. It explains that his actions have jeopardized the princess's mission, and that Lafiel's royal family will hire anyone wishing to aid her cause. The baron still has one trick up his sleeve, however, one that will ensure Lafiel will never be able to complete the task given to her aboard the Gosroth.

The enemy has also detected their presence and launches an attack, but Lafiel again displays some deft maneuvering and they are able to elude death once more. Though they've managed to survive the initial confrontation, Jinto and Lafiel's options are limited because the orbiting tower where they would have docked has been destroyed.

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Not wanting to unnecessarily drag anyone into her dispute with United Mankind, Lafiel insists that her anti-empire captors-turned-allies split from Jinto and herself in the underground tunnels in which they've sought refuge. There are too many men in pursuit and not enough pathways, however, and Jinto and Lafiel eventually run into a dead end. Though the bombs lobbed in their direction succeed in causing slight injury, they also open the way for the duo to flee into the amusement park on the other side of the wall that had previously blocked their escape. They haven't reached safety just yet, however, because the city police force -- also involved in the chase but familiar with Jinto and Lafiel's secret route -- has anticipated the pair's arrival. Doing their best to avoid capture, they make the mistake of backtracking through the park and again encounter United Mankind's military. Now hunted by two irate and heavily armed groups, Jinto and Lafiel's options seem limited, even when the"

Despite her best efforts, a devastating blast cripples her ship. Systems fail one by one. With nowhere to run, the ship is destroyed. The scene goes black and the screen reveals that the battle simulation is over. Lafiel, visibly disappointed by her performance, leaves her other crew members. The other crew members urge Jinto to cheer her up. Jinto argues that treating her like a child might make her angry, and that an angry Abh is no better than a depressed Abh. He says they're reading too much into her reaction, but he agrees to talk to her. It has been three years since the events of Crest of the Stars. When they talk, we see that both have grown up some. Lafiel is taking on important responsibilities as an actual ship captain. Jinto is more self-assured and frank (though Lafiel calls this \"\"being full of himself\"\").

Spoor's forces obliterate the fortress. Bored with the easy win, Spoor ignores the president of Aptic III's challenges that his people will keep fighting. The shocked president soon learns, through Spoor, how all Abhs are not alike. Meanwhile, Admiral Kenesh, the chief of staff of Operation Phatom Flame, discusses the Abh strategy with his staff. Spoor will advance the 1st Fleet and capture the enemy's major gates, with the 3rd and 5th following as a supply line.

Jinto and Lafiel discuss the odd situation of Hecto-Commander Atosuryua being the commander of their battalion. Three years ago, as chronicled in Crest of the Stars, Lafiel killed Atosuryua's older brother, the treacherous and insane Baron Febdash. Lafiel insists that Atosuryua is beyond making that an issue, but Jinto isn't so sure. Later, on the bridge, Ekuryua makes a case for letting Jinto's cat, Diaho, stay on the ship. Meanwhile the president of Aptic tries to work out a compromise in which the Ahb will demand his surrender, as he wants to put on a show of fake defiance for his voters. Atosuryua meets Jinto to talk about her father and brother. The conversation seems strained, but she tells Jinto to relay the message to Lafiel that she, Atosur"

The mines barely miss the Basroil, but they do enter and explode within the space-time bubble of the last ship in their squadron. Weighted down by the remains of the mines, it will have to stay out of the battle. Lafiel realizes she is no longer afraid, and she wonders if that's why Jinto joined the ship -- so he could calm her. They break into the enemy's space-time bubble just in time to see an ally's ship be destroyed. Lafiel fires at the enemy. The laser hits, but does little damage. Another Abh ship goes down.
