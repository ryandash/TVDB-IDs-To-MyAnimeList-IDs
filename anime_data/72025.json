Instead of possibly an empty chair, the skeletal remains of an abh of royal descent (having some sort of jewel on it's forhead) is still sitting in the chair. They return to their own ship heading home to inform others of their findings. A few years later, a child is born unto Dubus and Plakia, Abriel Nei Dubrusk Paryunu Lafiel.

The burden of royalty is an uneasy one for Jinto, who is unaccustomed to the stares his Abh uniform attracts. His friends also find it difficult dealing with nobility. Just one, Dorin Ku, shows up to see him off at the spaceport. Before walking away, Ku leaves Jinto with a gift, a baseball signed by all of his absent friends. The ball comes in handy a short while later when a young thief steals a traveler's luggage, but it's not because of Jinto's less-than-impeccable aim. Rather, it's Lafiel, his beautiful Abh escort, who stops the crime. But she's greeted with hatred despite her good deed. Is this the type of life awaiting Jinto? If so",

The delay caused by their imprisonment has allowed the United Mankind to beat them to the planet of Sufugnoff, and the invasion they could have possibly prevented is already under way by the time they arrive. The enemy has also detected their presence and launches an attack, but Lafiel again displays some deft maneuvering and they are able to elude death once more. Though they've managed to survive the initial confrontation, Jinto and Lafiel's options are limited because the orbiting tower where they would have docked has been destroyed. With nowhere else to go, they turn their attention toward Sufugnoff's surface, but the ship in which they are traveling may not be equipped for the landing. Worse still, Lafiel -- despite all of her training -- has n",

Unfortunately, starving in the fields isn't a much better fate than being shot down in space, and they must eventually make their way to the city if they hope to survive. But Lafiel -- with her blue hair and elflike ears -- will have a hard time going unnoticed in the enemy-occupied city, meaning that Jinto will have to go it alone. After a trip to the pawnbroker, he returns to the cave in which Lafiel is hiding with food and clothing -- and black hair dye. Though taking great offense to the last item, she finally gives in, but their disguises do little to prevent them from being attacked by three troublemaking teens while on the road to the city. They are of course no match for Lafiel's military training, but soundly thrashing the teens -- and taking their vehicle in the process -- only leads to the United Mankind resuming th",

Unfortunately, the incident leads to a police investigation, one spearheaded by a United Mankind official looking for the occupants of the Abh pod that escaped to Sufugnoff. Upon the suggestion of the lead detective -- someone clearly annoyed by the prospect of collaborating with the invading army -- they concentrate their efforts upon searching the city's hotels, since new customers would be scarce in this time of military chaos.

Jinto and Lafiel do, however, agree to act as hostages, but any plan to engage the empire in negotiations will be put on hold, thanks to a United Mankind roadblock. An explosive thrown by Lafiel buys the group some time, but also leads the enemy to believe the anti-Abh revolutionaries are sympathizers of the empire.

Though the bombs lobbed in their direction succeed in causing slight injury, they also open the way for the duo to flee into the amusement park on the other side of the wall that had previously blocked their escape. They haven't reached safety just yet, however, because the city police force -- also involved in the chase but familiar with Jinto and Lafiel's secret route -- has anticipated the pair's arrival.

The scene goes black and the screen reveals that the battle simulation is over. Lafiel, visibly disappointed by her performance, leaves her other crew members. The other crew members urge Jinto to cheer her up. Jinto argues that treating her like a child might make her angry, and that an angry Abh is no better than a depressed Abh.
