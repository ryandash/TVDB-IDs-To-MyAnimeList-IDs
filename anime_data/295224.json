In 2065, six years before the events of Gods Eater Burst, God Eater Soma, a new member of the Fenrir Far East Branch, travels to a strategic command base in former Russia for his first mission, accompanied by teammate Lindow and his older sister Tsubaki. They are instructed to assist troops in guiding an Aragami colony towards a nuclear fusion reactor, which will be detonated to wipe them all out. Soon afterward, the Aragami attack the reactor and breach its primary defense. With the reactor still preparing to reach its critical point for an explosion, Soma, Lindow, and Tsubaki battle the Aragami to keep them rooted to their position and distracted. Though the God Eaters outmatch the Aragami forces, the soldiers retreat at the behest of their captain, abandoning the trio at the reactor. The captain then manually detonates the reactor, but an unknown force absorbs the nuclear explosion, preventing it from doing any cataclysmic damage. Soma, Lindow, and Tsubaki survive, and are evacuated by helicopter. As Lindow asks Soma if he is still willing to come with them in \"this messed-up world\", a mysterious figure watches the helicopter depart in the desert below.
