  "SummaryEnglish": "In a dystopian future, the Japanese government is cracking down on any perceived immoral activity from using risqué language to distributing lewd materials in the country, to the point where all citizens are forced to wear high-tech devices called Peace Makers (PM) at all times that analyse every spoken word and hand motions for any action that could break the law. A new high school student named Tanukichi Okuma enters the country's leading elite \"public morals school\" to reunite with his crush and student council President, Anna Nishikinomiya. However, Tanukichi quickly finds himself entwined with the perverted terrorist \"Blue Snow\" (\"Tundra's Blue\" in some translations) when she kidnaps and forces him to join her organisation, \"SOX,\" in creating and spreading pornographic material across the city as a form of protest against the regulations.",

Later, Ayame talks about her latest plan to reclaim a hidden stash of old pornographic material located on private property. She can't do it alone, so instead she plans to lure the students from school out to the property during the weekend. However, her plans are sidelined when Tanukichi is targeted by a stalker and Anna's mother, Sophia, shows up to the school in person to get the students to support her new legislation that would force all students to wear chastity belt-like devices. Running low on options, Ayame decides to have Tanukichi confront his stalker while Otome hides in a closet to draw lewd pictures herself. However, the stalker turns out to be Anna who restrains and assaults Tanukichi while being unable to understand her feelings. After Ayame accidentally interrupts them, Anna flees as Otome begins furiously drawing the scene with her teeth. Later that night, Hyouka confronts Anna in the lobby of her apartment, asking why her science lab was sterilized without asking. Anna responds that it was done out of love, as the more \"impure\" influences she eliminates, the more she will be rewarded with love, therefore everything she does for love is just.",

While escaping from Anna, he accidentally drops his bag filled with illegal material in Hyouka's lab and tells Ayame that he can't distribute them with Anna constantly trying to pin him down. On Sunday, the day of the \"X Prohibition Law\" signature drive, Sophia plans to greet the students of her daughter's academy in person and Ayame plans to quixotically storm the forest against a large force of morality police. Surprisingly, the students all show up at the forest, as Hyouka picked up Tanukichi's material and quietly spread copies around school herself. She manages to distract the police long enough for the female students and SOX to start looking for the hidden stash of porn. However, Anna shows up in person, chasing down Ayame in her Blue Snow disguise. Ayame tosses Tanukichi down into the forest to help him escape from Anna, where he finds the porn stash in a suggestively-shaped cave. However, when he hears Ayame being strangled by Anna, he decides to save her wearing a new disguise he found in the cave. Anna can't understand why the new terrorist gives her similar feelings to Tanukichi, and leaps into the forest in shame. Later that night, Sophia holds a press conference announcing the success of the petition drive, but discovers too late that someone replaced her signed petitions with pornographic artwork, which gets broadcast live around the country and embarrasses her push for the new law.",

The next day, Tanukichi accidentally activates the vibrator with the wireless remote Hyouka gave him, reawakening Anna's lust. Tanukichi tries desperately to escape or find a way to turn off the vibrator, but none of his friends want to help him, and Anna finally traps him inside the Student Council room.

At the school, the members of Gathered Fabric are making ransom demands with food and drinks as well as new panties, at the cost of provocative images of the students wearing panties on their heads if they fail to comply.
