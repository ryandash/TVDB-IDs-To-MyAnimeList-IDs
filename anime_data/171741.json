However, they are more infamously known as cursed eyes that can only bring destruction and death to others. Ryner Lute, a talented mage and also an Alpha Stigma bearer, was once a student of the Roland Empire's Magician Academy, an elite school dedicated to training magicians for military purposes. However, after many of his classmates died in a war, he makes an oath to make the nation a more orderly and peaceful place, with fellow survivor and best friend, Sion Astal. Now that Sion is the the king of Roland, he orders Ryner to search for useful relics that will aid the nation. Together with Ferris Eris, a beautiful and highly skilled swordswoman, Ryner goes on a journey to search for relics of legendary heroes from the past, and also uncover the secrets behind his cursed eyes.",

While Ryner is searching for relics of the so-called ‘legendary heroes’, he is confronted with soldiers from the Nelpha Empire, who use Nelphan magic in an attempt to kill Ryner, thinking he is a spy. But Ryner, using his Alpha Stigma, an ability in which he uses his eyes to analyse forms of magic, copies their magic, and counterattacks. Not wanting the enemy to learn and copy any secrets of their own magic, the Nelphan soldiers stop attacking. Suddenly, Ferris Eris, a young, beautiful girl from the Swords-Clan comes to Ryner’s aid. Though she was too late to stop the attack, she begins to explain to the Nelphans that Ryner couldn’t possibly be a spy. While Ryner was busy arguing with Ferris about “what does it make you, following that fop around”, the Nelphans attack yet again, this time Ferris showing them not to mess with a swordswoman.",
