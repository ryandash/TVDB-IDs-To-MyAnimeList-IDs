  "TitleEnglish": "Love Flops",
  "SummaryEnglish": "The anime centers on Asahi Kashiwagi, a student who one morning runs into a series of unusual accidents on one morning on the way to school — all in accordance with a vague television fortune he watched that morning, and all culminating with an unfortunate encounter with a girl. Coincidentally, all the girls he meets are new students or teachers at his school. Asahi's prior knowledge of the girls earns him the suspicion of Yoshio, a self-proclaimed \"friend of Asahi.\" After school, he finds a love letter in his shoe locker, telling him to come to the cherry blossom tree behind school, again according to his morning fortune. Asahi heads to the cherry blossom tree to see what awaits him.",
