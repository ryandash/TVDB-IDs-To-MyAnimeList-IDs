Adlet Mayer, self-proclaimed \"Strongest Man in the World,\" has arrived at the continent of Piena in hopes of becoming a Brave. Although it doesn't go as smoothly as he had planned, Adlet is ultimately chosen as one of the six heroes shortly after being greeted by Nashetania Loei Piena Augustra, crown princess and fellow Brave.

However, when they finally unite, seven heroes are present, and soon the others begin to suspect Adlet to be a fraud.
