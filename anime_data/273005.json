As the training camp continues Sawamura finds himself slowly improving, though he is removed from outfield practice due to his horrible plays. Chris lets him pitch, though only into the net. Unknown to everyone, the Coach arranges three practice games for the weekend to see how everyone will do at maximum fatigue. Sawamura and Furuya are scheduled to do Saturday's one game while Tanba and Kawakami are scheduled to do Sunday's double header. One day he finds himself called into Miyuki's room. Upon entering he sees all the upper classman waiting for him. At first he thinks they are going to beat him for taking Chris's roster spot, but he secretly wants them to get to know the upper classmen who will be fielding behind them. As Day 5 hits Sawamura and Furuya are sent into the bullpen to pitch and told they will pitch both batting practice and in the bullpen on Day 6 to get ready for their game on Day 7.
