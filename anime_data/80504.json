Fersen tells Oscar that he came to France for business---and due to his father's desire to find him a wife. Fersen has a prospective candidate in mind, but has never met her before, and he desperately asks Oscar if people should only marry for love. Antoinette is ecstatic at Fersen's return, but breaks down in tears when he tells her of his marriage plans. Oscar angrily asks Fersen why he told her this, and he says that he is wrongly in love with the Queen, and wants to break away from his feelings in order to do the right thing. Oscar spends the next few hours in emotional pain, and goes to an opera alone because Fersen is too saddened to attend. Antoinette, late for the concert, accidentally meets Fersen in the woods, and one thing leads to another.",

She also finds out that Andre is going blind. Company A is dispatched to fight armed citizens, and Company B is told to stand-by. Civilians begin raiding food and firearms. Oscar's portrait is finished. It portrays her as Mars, the Roman God of War, and is hailed as a masterpiece, but Andre can not see it. He describes Oscar's beauty in the painting with his imagination, moving Oscar to tears because he describes things that are not there. Company B is ordered to suppress a riot, and the two of them prepare to leave for the guard barracks. General Jarjayes is also dispatched. Before he leaves, he tells Andre that he would've allowed him to marry Oscar had he been a noble, and begs him not to die.",
