The group arrives at the core and Zest offers herself as bait for Basara to kill the beast. In doing so, however, Basara protects Zest and disables the vital core with his Banishing Shift, thus killing the beast. As the girls recover, Basara witnesses Yahiro/Lars executing Zolgear. Back at their home, Zest places her loyalty to Basara. Greatly opposed to the fact of someone else stealing Mio's virginity, Basara and Mio engage in lovemaking until Basara stops mid-way, apologizing for forcing himself unto Mio. As Basara and Mio were about to kiss once more, Yuki interferes and steals Basara's lips and is accompanied by Zest. As Mio and Yuki argue over Basara, the latter runs to Maria and asks her to help him appease the two. Adding to the uproar, Maria lunges at Basara and kisses him. Shella and Zest were then put under the care of the demons from the moderate-faction. Meanwhile, word of Zolgear's death eventually reaches Demon Lord Leohart as he faces Jin Tōjō in his throne."
