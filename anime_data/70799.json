But with sheer determination, Tyson pulls out a victory that puts the Bladebreakers ahead one to nothing in the best of three finals. The second round isn't quite so easy as Ray squares off against the NBA wanna-be Eddy whose blazing fast basketball style attack quickly knocks him out and evens the score at two a piece. It looks like the All Starz are shoo-ins to win because of their superior ability to collect data on their opponents. Now the stage is set for the final battle, but the question is, who from the Bladebreakers will take on the All Starz's number one player Michael? Kai or Max? In the end, it's Max who gets the nod.",

With the playing field even again, the Blader’s resume their match and Tyson wins. King's display of honesty generates a newfound respect for King and Queen from the Bladebreakers.",

Turns out Aaron refused to use the 'fixed' blade. Barthez is furious. Miguel is defiant and tell Barthez that they aren't going to be 'his puppets anymore.' As Barthez leaves, Miguel steps into the ring against Kai. The battle doesn't last very long as Kai wins handily. But Miguel has lost with dignity and that's just the way he wants it!",

The day before the match, Tyson has Daichi practice moves with him that they’re not usually accustomed to doing: namely, tag-team attacks. F Dynasty is renowned for their tag-team abilities, and Tyson wants nothing more than to beat them at their own game. He knows this will be a challenge, as F Dynasty has already used the tag-team format to defeat White Tiger X earlier in the tournament. But as the former Beyblade world champion, Tyson feels it’s his duty to prove that he’s the best, no matter what the format is. F Dynasty meanwhile, foregoes practicing in favor of another fantastic street show of their beyblading skills for a crowd of onlookers. In a flashback to their childhood, we learn that Raul and Julia have been performing as a duo since their formative years growing up in the circus. The introduction of beyblades to their act only solidified their skills. When the day of the match arrives, Tyson specifically requests the two-on-two format and F Dynasty agrees. The sand-filled Sahara dish gives Tyson and Daichi the pre-battle advantage, but during the match, Tyson’s beyblade has trouble keeping up. Coach Hiro realizes that the pressure Tyson is feeling to carry his team as the former Beyblade champion is affecting his performance. But this realization comes too late. Raul and Julia pull off another spectacular tag-team assault and defeat Tyson and Daichi. This results in an unusual predicament.

          "SummaryEnglish": "Tyson and Daichi disguise themselves in an effort to get badly needed replacement parts for their damaged Beyblades. But without an official BEGA I.D. card signifying membership in the new league – something they steadfastly refuse to get - they’re shut out from getting parts at any store. Despairing about how they’ll solve this dilemma, they’re visited by members of various teams they fought against in the World Championships: White Tiger X, PPB All Starz, Barthez Battalion, and F Dynasty. These former foes don’t like Boris and his professional BEGA league either, seeing this new entity as a threat to the sport of Beyblading. They vow to help Tyson and the other members of the BBA Revolution in whatever way they can to overthrow BEGA. Boarding a bus to the location Tyson and Daichi trained at, two questions remain unanswered. Which players from this talented assemblage will form the new five-player team to contend against BEGA’s best? And can they create a new, more powerful Beyblade with which to accomplish this task? Hilary surprises all by displaying her new ‘Hilary Star Flash’ persona in an attempt to secure a spot on the team as a player. Her skills are lacking however, and she’s relegated to helping Mr. Dickenson, Grandpa and Mr. Tate prepare food for the group. But despite Hilary’s setback, Mariah, Julia and Matilda show the boys that the girls can indeed compete for one of the five player positions on the squad. Practice, battling and training is the order of the day as everyone vies for one of the coveted spots, which have yet be decided. As for the Beyblade situation, Kenny, Miguel and Emily succeed in utilizing data from past battles and leftover parts to create the revolutionary new Beyblade they’ve been seeking – Dragoon Metal Storm.",

Kai realizes something's fishy, but before he can do anything about it, Brooklyn takes the win, much to Boris's liking. So the BEGA Blader’s team has been picked, now it's up to Tyson and his crew to pick a team. After much discussion about it, they all agree it should be up to Tyson to choose, but Tyson (even though he wants to pick Kai), doesn't say anything. The next day the tournament begins and our hero’s new team (now named the 'G Revolutions' by Mr. Dickenson) arrive at Bega Stadium. At first they present only four Blader’s, however, they finally reveal their fifth… they call him 'Mr. X' but it's really Grandpa in a mask.

However, when Ming Ming gains the upper hand this makes Daichi very annoyed. Worst of all, Ming Ming has the nerve to break into song as if to mock Daichi. Even worse, her singing seems to make her Blading improve and she slams Strata Dragoon relentlessly. Kenny, a devoted fan of Ming Ming’s, realizes that it’s her voice that helps her concentrate on her blade and Tyson tells Daichi of her secret. Daichi uses his own voice to unleash the full power of Strata Dragoon but in the end Ming Ming proves to be the better blader and wins the match.

BEGA’s team is up two games to nil in the best-of-five series. If they lose another match, BEGA will be victorious and have complete control over the sport of Beyblading. This puts a lot of pressure on Max to win game three against Mystel. Tyson and the others argue whether Max’s signature defensive style will be enough to overcome Mystel’s unpredictable and overpowering attack. Max takes this as a sign that his teammates only think he can win if he changes the way he Beyblades altogether. His confidence shattered, Max isolates himself and does some soul-searching. He receives a morale boost from an unlikely source – Rick, his contentious PPB All Starz partner. Rick helps Max realize that his trademark style is what made him so successful as a Blader, and it would be foolish not to use it just because the odds are against him. Max never wanted to give up his defensive tactics in the first place, so Rick’s advice only strengthens his resolve to simply do what he does best. When the time comes for his battle against Mystel, Max uses his time-tested strategies. He’s quickly overwhelmed by Mystel’s wild, hard-hitting attack, and defeat seems eminent. But Draciel’s spectacular defense curtails the downward spiral, and the match ends in a draw. The stalemate result isn’t the victory that Max desired, but it successfully postpones any chance of losing the tournament for at least one more match. For the underdog G Revolutions team, momentum has finally turned in their favor.",

Having suffered his only previous defeat at the hands of Kai, Brooklyn’s thirst for revenge takes the form of an unearthly power. Not only has his Beyblade Zeus given Brooklyn sinister black wings with which to fly, it has generated a giant vortex in the sky that is wreaking havoc on the city. Buildings are crumbling everywhere. The entire world is being enveloped by the growing darkness. Only Tyson can stop Brooklyn before it’s too late. Summoning his own formidable power from Dragoon, Tyson flies into the sky to convince Brooklyn to cease the negative emotions that are causing the havoc. When reasoning fails, the pair continues their battle above the ever-crumbling city. The tide turns in Tyson’s favor when he is able to summon the spirits of his teammates’ blades and merge them with Dragoon, which evolves into the most powerful Beyblade ever. By probing deeper into Brooklyn’s psyche, Tyson learns that his foe's anxiety stems from childhood isolation at being a genius so early in life. Tyson makes Brooklyn see that Beyblading is a pure sport to be enjoyed for one reason alone – the love of the game. Brooklyn calms down. The chaos ends. And the pair continues their match simply for enjoyment. With BEGA's HQ in shambles, the upstart league and its owner Boris are ruined. Mr. Dickenson’s BBA league restarts, but in a much more modest form.
