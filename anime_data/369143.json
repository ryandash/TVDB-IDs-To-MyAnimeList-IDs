While investigating illegal acts by a certain pharmaceutical company, Seizaki stumbles upon a page stained with a mixture of blood, hair and skin, along with the letter \"F\" scribbled all across the sheet. As he investigates further, the case goes beyond Zen's imagination and becomes vastly complex, challenging his sense of justice and his knowledge of the truth. Digging deeper into the investigation, Zen begins to uncover a concealed plot behind the ongoing mayoral election and ties to many people of interest involved in the election and those closer than he thinks.
