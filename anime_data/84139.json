  "SummaryEnglish": "In the future, people with ESP are becoming more widespread and with it, the necessity of constructively utilizing their unique capabilities. Unfortunately, there are also espers that abuse their powers and wield them to destructive ends. The Japanese government's solution of choice to both challenges is the establishment of the Base of Backing ESP Laboratory (B.A.B.E.L.) for the purpose of appraising, identifying, nurturing, and protecting espers (even if that means apprehending them as if they were criminals). Five decades later, B.A.B.E.L. locates a trio of natural Level 7 (the maximum esper potency designation) espers within Japan and assembles them into the special esper team known as \"The Children.\"",

The National Police Agency director arrives with the perspective that age is not an excuse against a citizen being obligated to assist in criminal investigations. The revelation that Shiho is the daughter of the Director marginalized for the moment to subside, Minamoto quickly departs with Shiho after making it clear that there better be a logical rationale for ordering Shiho's psychometry wielded in policework before he cooperates. Not being able to see anything insightful with her psychometry during Detective Uchida's initial tour through Maked Justice's journey, Shiho eventually reasons that Masked Justice actively hunts for quarry to attack without warning rather than randomly encountering it. Shiho successfully identifying the perpetrator does her little good as she is suddenly abducted after being isolated from her teammates. The abduction foiled with a couple of telekinetic shoves from Kaoru and a dropped object on Aoi's part, Uchida's attack is foiled by the Director's timely intervention. During the car ride home, Shiho assures Minamoto that she is accustomed to there being a dysphoric face to the world because he protects her right alongside Kaoru and Aoi.",

Kaoru and Mary's rivalry flaring up again is only extinguished by Ken's cacophonous recital of Colonel Grisham's back story of his recuperation expedited by no small margin at the hands of a young Japanese girl named Saya, prompting Minamoto to investigate the epilogue. The decision to only use telekinesis in the ensuing confrontation is complicated by the Colonel having telepathically predicted the assault and wielding the telekinesis to double the detrimental effect. Angered about the Colonel's mammary depiction, Kaoru and Mary's combined telekinesis starts to drain away the reservoir to reveal an abandoned city. As Naomi accelerates the process with her telekinesis, Minamoto explains that Colonel Grisham's defection is a mirage driven by his desire to have both Japan and Comerica drain away the reservoir so that the terminally-ill Saya (who he had Aoi and Shiho transport to the scene) could see her birthplace one final time. After they take a short respite to recover themselves, Kaoru, Mary, and Naomi rally their combined telekinesis behind the Colonel to finally drain the reservoir and set the water aside. Recalling his role in Colonel Grisham's current status, Kyōsuke even decides to lend his hypnotic assistance to cast Saya as the young girl with her house as it was 60 years ago and smooth out the political aftermath with the Comerican government.",

Finding that they have left early in the morning for their euphoric diurnal engagements, Kaoru reminisces back five years ago when she met Shiho and Aoi after arriving at B.A.B.E.L. and sets to spying on her teammates frightened of her special esper team disbanding. Minamoto finds Kaoru sulking and decides to engage her in a one-on-one euphoric diurnal engagement. Minamoto's protests of hauling a large payload of purchased items of dubious necessity and utility gives way to seeing the B.A.B.E.L. One helicopter flying overhead complying Taizō's volition to disrupt Shiho and Aoi's dates at all costs. As Minamoto reads Taizō the riot act for his behavior, Kaoru telekinetically demonstrates her intense jealousy but fortunately sees the light when a B.A.B.E.L. soldier is forbidding romantic relationships between espers and normal people before having Shiho and Aoi led away. A thoroughly-demolished E.C.M. generator and a bunch of telekinetically-scattered B.A.B.E.L. soldiers later, Taizō is read the riot act for the wasted company time and taxpayer money while Kaoru reconciles with Shiho and Aoi who (after having broken up their incipient relationships) are jealous of her extra one-on-one time with Minamoto.",

Back at B.A.B.E.L. Headquarters, a very anguished Ichirō shares a collection of photographs that he has taken of Naomi. After the sentiment of him having dubious ethics subsides for the moment, Ichirō shows some recent photographs that show Naomi confronting a boy and of her shoplifting. Despite the feeling of deja vu, Kaoru, Shiho and Aoi realize that Ichirō is sincerely worried about Naomi; at Minamoto's behest, Akira begins the investigation by metempsychotically possessing a hamster and searching through the Kuretake B.A.B.E.L. Girls' Dormitory to find Naomi's room—the journey thereof being quite an adventure. Minamoto and Sakaki continue to watch Naomi conduct herself through a normal school day to find nothing of interest until Naomi (after dressing the part) sets course toward a biker bar to ask the gang there about a rash of robberies vectored at junior high students that have taken place in their neighborhood. During her explanation, the photographs that Ichirō recently took are of Naomi confronting a boy (who had sold some stolen property and given the revenue to the gang) and then secretly returning the stolen item. After an argument about the merits of believing the best of people versus always assuming the worst, the bad apple Yatsu is illuminated. A chase ending in a joint Kaoru-Naomi telekinetic bungee cord and a tearful embrace exchange between brother bikers before the police arrive to arrest Yatsu later, Naomi finds herself with a personal protection and inspiration detail within the Young Tigers Motor Gang Red.",

Unfortunately, Momotarō loses his balance and unwisely tries to save the seeds—the penalty of which is induction into the slipstream of a passing truck and being electrocuted. Several hours later, Kaoru discovers the unconscious Momotarō during the return trip home from school and immediately decides to nurse him back to health at home—a decision that Shiho and Aoi are not entirely thrilled with. During his metempsychotic possession of a bird, Akira spotting an abandoned laboratory in the forest prompts Minamoto to call a recess and investigate. Meanwhile, after Kaoru cautiously attempts to feed Momotarō (who snaps awake to angrily chomp her finger not understanding her intentions), Shiho psychometrically discovers that Momotarō has no memory. Kashiwagi's arrival to keep an eye on the girls complicates things with the prospect of Momotarō's dysphoric discovery. Another psychotic episode of Momotarō acting out prompts Minamoto to explain that residential coexistence with Momotarō is impossible because of the wartime experimentation done on him. As if to prove Minamoto's situational ethics correct, Momotarō recovering himself to again jump to conclusions ignites another battle. After objecting to Minamoto chasing after Momotarō on the grounds that he is what she along with Shiho and Aoi once were—a maltreated creature whose life is of the same priceless value that theirs are, Kaoru leads her teammates after Hatsune and convince her to stand down before confronting Momotarō. Kyōsuke arrives to aid Kaoru with the sentiment that espers can only be truly understood by another esper before departing with Momotarō (who has come to his senses enough to truly understand Kaoru's intentions).

As Minamoto attempts to convince Taizō against wielding Shiho's psychometry in the investigation, Dr. Sakaki is allowing his libido to get the better of him as he examines a patient—and would have succeeded if not for Minamoto's timely arrival with the affirmation of his participation in the upcoming euphoric nocturnal engagement. After a week of accompanying Dr. Sakaki on his nocturnal playboy adventures, Minamoto finds no sign of impending treachery—nor an avenue for proving it. Frustrated at their leader's obfuscation to their legitimate inquiries, Shiho tries using her psychometry but is foiled by an active device that guards against telepathy and psychometry. As the girls summon Naomi as well as Natsuko and Hotaru to act as a deus ex machina, Kugutsu even gets into the act by creating a life-size doll of Minamoto to throw off the girls—who are neither deceived or amused at the mirage as they rush out after their leader. The girls' first stop is at B.A.B.E.L.

Sakaki's arrival prompts a battle with Mio's assistant whose fighting becomes fiercer as his background and Mio's back story inspiring the advent of P.A.N.D.R.A. are revealed. Kaoru confronting Minamoto's affection for Mio (who is wearing a new outfit that Minamoto gave her) instigates another battle that Mio begins by creating two other clones whose merits and demerits are clearly demonstrated -- Aoi having trouble with her Mio clone and Shiho trapping hers using an old construction machine. Minamoto turning the tables by seizing Mio's immobile lower half to take it out of range and Aoi's Mio clone becoming emaciated before eventually vanishing offers little comfort as Shiho's Mio clone goes berserk. A correlation flashback and a frenzied clone attack on Kaoru's part inspires Mio to see the light and subjugate the berserker before retreating with a vow of revenge.

Headquarters citing the drama in Kyoto from the previous episode. After she gets over the euphoria of winning the race (and conking Dr. Sakaki on the head with a game controller), Kaoru's full-blown temper tantrum and accusation of Shiho of losing the race on purpose prompts Sakaki to advise Shiho to hold back a bit from commenting on what comes to mind. Shiho is about to riposite her perspective on Sakaki's advice when Kaoru suggests that Sakaki and Shiho race against each other, the duration thereof defined by lots of psychometric trash-talking -- and Sakaki losing to Shiho's concentration and his overconfidence. Shiho psychometrically teaching herself how to use the fishing pole to catch the quarry fish on the first try (to the astonishment of Sakaki who is a veteran angler) gives way to an encounter with Dr. Sakaki's old instructor from Touto University that teaches Shiho to turn her back on ignorance and morally be the bigger woman as Sakaki tends to the seasick Kaoru before seeing to the Professor who is bleeding internally from a ruptured spleen. As he operates on the Professor, Sakaki explains to Shiho (who is grossed out by all the blood/gore) that psychometric inspection is not the same as actual viewing before confessing that he is envious of Shiho's fortune. Sakaki tells Shiho that Minamoto is the one normal that could understand/celebrate him for the person he is and that she is lucky that she can be a kid thanks to having Minamoto to intercede for her when/how appropriate. Professor Saisen's ruptured spleen being successfully repaired (along with the misunderstanding between the two) gives way to Dr. Sakaki and Shiho preparing the fish that they caught as a welcome-home dinner for Aoi and Minamoto.",

          "SummaryEnglish": "This episode is more of a comical retrospective analysis of a camping/hiking school field trip conducted as a hybrid between a police interrogation and the Christian sacrament of confession as is demonstrated with Chisato who begins by explaining that Kaoru (and to a lesser extent) along with Shiho and Aoi were all excited about the field trip during the bus ride there. During the actual hiking trip, Kaoru and her teammates painting their leader Minamoto as a common relative of theirs prompts Chisato to recount that she has had euphoric company with Minamoto. Chisato's euphoric daydream example is quickly extinguished when a small pebble hits Kaoru who immediately accuses Touno of the offense in spite of the evidence indicating the inverse. Kaoru bragging about her homemade lunch ignites Touno's jealousy and a keep-away game whose aftermath is a scavenger hunt that nobody was prepared for. During a layover to wait out the rainstorm, Shiho and Aoi debate how to locate Kaoru (who is out of communication range) while Chisato jumps to conclusions from the limited data provided by her Level 2 telepathy. Kaoru and Touno's heart-to-heart to understand each other better quickly yields to the below-ground facility being elevated at-ground at Taizou's behest. Kaoru reunited with her teammates/classmates and her lost lunch has all the makings of a happy ending -- and would have been if Mio had not seized Kaoru's lunch away. P.A.N.D.R.A. seems to have learned of the below-ground facility that Taizou had built and has charged Mio, Muscle, and Momotarou the exploration and appraisal thereof. The resolution of some enigmas gives way to a comical keep-away game with Kaoru's lunch that ends in a B.A.B.E.L. victory due to Momotarou's inability to stay aloft with the mass of Kaoru's lunch.",

Kaoru and her teammates who know to steer clear), B.A.B.E.L. is predicting a large-scale biological disaster and mobilizing to pre-empt it. Once inside the building, the B.A.B.E.L. crew finds several unconscious workers with swelled bumps on their heads. As he watches a mosquito fly around to land on Kaoru and then on Aoi, Minamoto realizes that the contamination is not why the workers are unconscious while he recovers himself from crashing into the wall. Shiho psychometrically confirming what Minamoto already knows and explaining the whole situation at hand quickly yields to Minamoto having been taken over by thousands of mosquitoes much to the delight of Kyousuke and Momotarou. Frightened for his gonads, Kyousuke advises that incapacitating the mosquito psychometer and exterminating the mosquitoes should resolve the situation -- a task Kaoru finds easier said than done since her telekinesis repels them right against the glass windows containing the whole pestilence. The deux es machina comes when Kaoru is advised to subjugate the mosquitoes by telekinetically moving the air around and instigating the fire extinguishers. The mosquitoes drowning in the water from the fire extinguishers (and Shiho adding washing detergent to accelerate their demise), the mosquito psychometer trapped in a vice, the emergency responders doing their thing down below, and Minamoto's factual *destination perdition* counterargument . . . none of that convinces Kyousuke to soften his heart toward human-esper peaceful coexistence.",

Even as she detects his decreasing proximity and rushes to intercept him, Takashi uses a decoy rabbit to distract Hatsune and scores the unexpected bonus of Keiko being a lupine lunch for having Hatsune's necklace in hand. Minamoto being none too thrilled with the prospect of Hatsune's residence with his esper charges quickly takes a back seat to Takashi synthesizing a website to auction off his ill-gotten payload. Mio having successfully evacuated Takashi, Hatsune turning her anger on Keiko illuminates the root cause for Hatsune's absconding: Keiko's clumsy leadership being exacerbated by Akira's sycophantic and uxorious affinity for her. Everything goes according to plan during the simulated polar medical rescue mission until a solar flare induces a magnetic storm that occludes communication. Unable to abort the mission and the B.A.B.E.L. rations of no utility, Hatsune first tries to make a meal out of Keiko before turning her attention to a baby narwhal she had captured without much effort only to find that the baby narwhal's parent emphatically disagrees with her menu plan through a fierce roller-coaster sequence of deep dives and breaching the ice. Keiko realizes her groove in within B.A.B.E.L. as The Hound team leader when she urges the baby narwhal back to sea with its parent and quickly extinguishes Hatsune's hysterical tirade with an abrupt and potent »Get a grip on yourself!!!« slap across the chops before wrapping herself and Hatsune with insulating blankets under the luminous reward of the aurora.",

A chess-computation campaign regarding the next counterattack against Black Phantom commences as Kyousuke administrates over a housekeeping conference with his subordinates over the previous operation while B.A.B.E.L. medically appraises both Kaoru and Barret. While he and Dr. Sakaki are computing how to interpret Barret's esper powers and life memories being extinguished with the Black Phantom subjugation, Fujiko's admonishment about wielding at all times a powerful hand blaster developed to kill espers whose corporeal constitution defies normal weaponry prompts Minamoto to renew his resolve to extinguish Kyousuke's volition unaware that P.A.N.D.R.A. has decided upon its next move which Shiho psychometrically detects among the mail Aoi has brought in.

Before anybody can stop her, Kaoru finds herself in Minamoto's cerebral pseudo-reality and that Minamoto bearing the burden of Ikyuugo's final prediction by himself is the engine driving the pseudo-reality. While Kaoru conscripts Minamoto into what she thinks is the deus ex machina needed to emancipate them both, B.A.B.E.L. has successfully located Setsuko holed up by herself but finds that it will take more than a Taizou Kiritsubo bulldozer blitzkrieg to apprehend her since there is a minefield surrounding the place.

There is little that can go awry as Takashi is in seventh heaven with Kaoru and her teammates warmly accepting him as is . . . except for the sudden arrival of Takashi's father Tekeno who has written his antipathy for espers into a book.

What drives this lesson home, however, is a terrorist attack by The Normal People who show their anger at Aoi frenzily teleporting the people to safety by driving several tanker trucks loaded with fuel into the congregation.

The euphoric epilogue is enhanced even more when Tekeno sees the light and demonstrates that the love for his son is greater than his ignorance regarding espers having realized that it is the virtue or vice within the heart that determines whether ESP is wielded constructively or destructively.",

          "SummaryEnglish": "Fujiko summoning Minamoto to an exhibition of unsolved probability case file #666 (better known as »Do The Children become demons or angels in the future?«) now boasting an almost 50% probability of The Children falling to vice along with an uncertainty score of almost 12% before again presenting to him the high-powered blaster from before obfuscates Kyousuke's poor health and hints that time is not on Kyousuke's side. An extrapolative epilogue set in the future features Kaoru (as an adult) flying back to Minamoto's apartment knowing that she will encounter her teammates Shiho and Aoi who give her a frosty greeting over her P.A.N.D.R.A. allegiance/affiliation. The altercation that ensues is only interrupted when a music box floats onto the scene -- an anniversary gift to the trio from Minamoto symbolizing the good times they once shared. In the present, Kaoru and her teammates being disappointed that Minamoto has chosen to congratulate their promotion to fifth grade with a scaled-down pastry sets the stage for Kyousuke to summon the girls into a dormant amusement park to encourage them to have fun with their psychic powers. While making a meal of reheated food, Kyousuke explains his prologue of basically hating all normals because of his commanding officer's mortal attempt on his life. Incensed by his prejudice, Kaoru flies Kyousuke out of the apartment into a fierce battle that starts out as the latter mocking the former. After turning the tables on Kyousuke by concentrating her powers, Kaoru leads everybody into the important lesson to seize upon today since it is not certain what will happen tomorrow as is demonstrated in several forums near the end of the episode.",

          "SummaryEnglish": "An undercover operation at a hotel to apprehend illegal weapon dealers proceeds along swimmingly until Kaoru is sent into a frenzy by a bevy of bombs meant for Minamoto only for her psychokinesis to short-circuit and become its own beast that is only subjugated by Minamoto energizing Kaoru's limiter. Minamoto decides to have Kaoru sit out the next mission due to her neural damage -- a wise decision except that the lack of supervision is read as a signal for Mio to phase in with an exhortation of her assistance against Black Phantom. Hearing the name Black Phantom after a snapshot of Kaoru's prologue involving Yoshimi is more than enough reason for Kaoru to leap into action against her better judgment. After a brief battle with Kazura and Kagari, Momiji stopping Kaoru and smashing her limiter without realizing the consequences gives way to a demonstration of how a P.A.N.D.R.A. mission is conducted that thoroughly incenses Kaoru. While searching for Black Phantom's latest vassal Patty Crew, the P.A.N.D.R.A. espers share their prologue and that they rely heavily on brute force which Patty perverts to their detriment. Galvanized by a new perspective on the past, Kaoru combines psychic energies with the P.A.N.D.R.A. espers to extinguish the Black Phantom subjugation. While successfully emulating the Collaborative Deluge limiters is a marvelous engineering feat in its own right, the P.A.N.D.R.A. espers do not have the per capita power and goodwill to make their Collaborative Deluge work the way that of B.A.B.E.L. does.",

          "SummaryEnglish": "While enjoying the epilogue of a job well done, Naomi delivers a »Keep away from me!!!« psychokinetic shove to Ichirou before flying home completely unaware that her repulsion sets the stage for the Black Phantom vassal Yuri to initiate her mission. Minamoto's computations on the significance of the thistle found with Ichirou give way to being charged a mission. It is no problem for the girls to apprehend the perpetrator esper even as their mammaries breach their uniforms. Upon finding another thistle, Minamoto decides to stay behind to prosecute an investigation along with some computations only to find that Black Phantom's volition is to wield his esper charges as their vassals. Further inflaming matters, Kyousuke has decided to »rehabilitate« Minamoto by wielding Momotarou to effect the mirage of Minamoto as a 12 year old boy before phasing out. Dr, Sakaki's explanation of the cerebral reconfiguration that has been done gives way to Kaoru and her teammates having the time of their lives with their leader in his child state setting aside for the moment the amplified danger of Black Phantom. The scope of Kyousuke's »rehabilitation« is most emphatically demonstrated when P.A.N.D.R.A. occupies the girls' school and configures everybody's computations as if Mio and Kyousuke have always been their classmates while Minamoto expounds upon his prologue. Akira and Hatsune now in estivation and unable to challenge her, Yuri resumes her mission .",

          "SummaryEnglish": "Akira availing his metempsychosis through a bird to explain what happened to his team along with Oboro watching over Fujiko and Dr. Sakaki as they combine energies to repair the damage done to Ichirou's mind establishes the ambiance as Kaoru continues to be in seventh heaven with Kouichi (Minamoto in his child state) while Yuri regroups to compute her next move. The P.A.N.D.R.A.-polluted school day proceeds along without incident although the lunchtime ambiance hints that P.A.N.D.R.A.'s control is starting to weaken. Kouichi asserting himself when Kaoru and her teammates attempt to feed him prompts a sequence of the adult Minamoto telling Kouichi to reject this phantasm even as Kyousuke offers to expend his life energy reformatting the circumstances. Shiho's appraisal and collaborative congratulations for the successful bootstrapping ignites a fit of hysterical ambivalence that sends Kouichi racing to meet Kyousuke and rouses Yuri into commencing her true mission: exterminating Kaoru so that she cannot wield the Collaborative Deluge against Black Phantom. Upon detecting Black Phantom's machinations, Taizou calls B.A.B.E.L. to arms but finds P.A.N.D.R.A. inhibiting their advance so that Kyousuke can hypnotically subjugate Kouichi. Naomi arrives on the scene to capitalize upon Yuri's reluctance about her mission and exhort Kaoru's intercession before collapsing in exhaustion. Kaoru's collaborative remonstration with Shiho and Aoi instigates Yuri to take Kouichi hostage -- a futile gesture that is as dust before a maelstrom to a constructive and altruistic relationship as is evidenced in the epilogue of Kaoru, Shiho, and Aoi's affirmation for Kouichi Minamoto's guardianship.",

          "SummaryEnglish": "An opulent party aboard an oceanliner that P.A.N.D.R.A. swiftly commandeers in its perpetual avarice for finance and infantry sets the stage for Mio to wonder about Kaoru and her teammates whose emphatic exhortations for a trip to the beach are consistently met with an abrupt but paternal »Schoolwork first!!!« repulsion from Minamoto while The Hound special esper team is busy assisting the police in trying to apprehend an esper that misunderstands what a gift his Level 5 powers are. Considering the difficulty Hatsune is having and how much she hates homework, Kaoru is only too happy to leap into action with her teammates. The injunction against excessive force along with counsel to corner the fugitive firmly in mind, Kaoru and her teammates chase the perpetrator into a tunnel and intercede for him against an oncoming train; a rousing inspirational speech later, the perpetrator reneges on his suicide threat and capitulates. The epilogue is a collage of scenes depicting the immediate future of several people. Kaoru, Shiho, and Aoi have all graduated from elementary school while Naomi has graduated from high school into being a college student. Keiko is charged the supervision of Barret and Tim as special espers. The P.A.N.D.R.A. espers driving each other bananas while Kyousuke drinks tea obfuscates Chisato and Touno's encounter with Yuri already dressed in the school's uniform either having been purified by the Collaborative Deluge or is simply an excellent actress while she waits to be wielded by Black Phantom. Kaoru is sent on another mission with her teammates adorned in their new mission uniforms.",
