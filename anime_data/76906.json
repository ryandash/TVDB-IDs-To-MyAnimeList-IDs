The Medafighter tells Ikki that over 100 Medabots attacked him at one time and defeated his Kintaro-Type Medabot Kintaro. He can't remember seeing an Medafighter, and only remembers a white and blue Medabot with horns. A blue and white Medabot with no Medafighter? That description fits Rokusho, but he can't possibly be the one that did this terrible thing, can he? When Rokusho is confronted, the truth is revealed - it was indeed Rokusho who interrupted their training, but for good reason. Acting alone, Rokusho did this because they were cutting down trees during their training. He stopped their training not with force but with compassion. This sounds more like the Rokusho that we know!",
