    "SummaryEnglish": "The story centers around Akihisa Yoshii, the \"baka\" of the title. His academy rigidly divides up the student body into classes based on the results of tests. The prodigies are in the A class with reclining seats complete with air conditioning, but Akihisa is in F class, the lowest rung of the school ladder which is furnished only with low, decrepit tables and worn-out straw tatami mats. A girl named Mizuki Himeji is actually one of the smartest girls in Akihisa's sophomore year, but she had a fever on test day and was pigeonholed into the F class. Besides Mizuki (who Akihisa secretly adores), the F class also has Yūji Sakamoto, the class president who has been Akihisa's friend and partner-in-crime since the freshman year. The school happens to have developed experiments to summon fantasy creatures, and Akihisa decides to rally F class to take on the higher-tiered classes and seize their perks. The F class uses the summoned creatures in an all-out battle for school supremacy.",

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Class F works on a Chinese maid café for the school's cultural festival. At first, the plan works out okay, but soon the Tonkonatsu duo come along and accidentally eat one of the sample sesame balls, which were made by Himeji's terrible cooking skills. Accusing them of trying to kill them, Yūji uses \"Persuasive Negotiations\" in the forms of \"Persuasive Negations using Fists\", \"Persuasive Negations using Kicks\" and \"Persuasive Negations using Wrestling\", which drives away the duo. After their departure, business starts to fail. Minami's little sister arrives, promising to help. She tells them that while she was looking Akihisa, people tell her bad rumors about the Chinese cafe. Yūji deducts that the failure of their business is because the Tonkonatsu duo is spreading ill rumors about them. This is confirmed with a visit to class A's Maid Cafe, while watching the Tonkonatsu duo shouting out the rumors. Akihisa and Yūji hatch a plan to ruin the duo's image, (which involves Akihisa wearing a maid costume) and works greatly. The duo does not appreciate this, and kidnap Hideyoshi. Akihisa misinterprets and thinks they kidnapped Himeji and Minami. The Duo states that they are going to \"have their fun with them\". They then use Kōta's various hidden cameras and audio cameras to find the duo in the athletic's storage. Akihisa storms toward the storage still in the maid outfit, and punches the duo. He awkwardly finds Hideyoshi playing a board game(she also explains that Minami and Himeji are at the cafe). At the end of the day, their Chinese Cafe earns enough money to buy the equipment they want (with the help of Kōta and his \"deluxe photo collection\") , but they can only buy the equipment under one condition: they must win a Summoning Contest. Kōta announces the favorite maid of the day, and it was Akihisa. Both Himeji, Minami and Hideyoshi ponder over this, while Akihisa freaks out over the said results."

As they progress in the Summoning Tournament, they use tricks to win most of their battles, such as when they attempt to force Yūji into admitting he loves Shōko, but Yūji's resistance leads to his eventual unconsciousness and Akihasa using him as a puppet, with Hideyoshi using a voice muzzler to imitate Yūji's voice. Throughout the course of the tournament, Yūji suspects that someone is sabotaging the tournament, leading them to battle Classes B & A. In the end, The Tonkonatsu Duo are revealed to be the ones committing the said sabotage. Yūji secretly calls Pervert to cheat as well, changing the subject from the intended English to Japanese History, the only subject Akihasa studied hard for. they soon defeat them, but they run of to the PA system to reveal each other's cheating to change the win of Akihasa and Yūji into a stalemate, which defeats the purpose of them entering the tournament. Akihasa then runs after them, using a firework launcher to try and shoot them down. In the end, he accidentally bumped one of the other firework launchers, ending the night in a fiery blaze while Iron Man takes them both to their punishment. In the end, they had exhausted all their money compensating for the damage, and are saddened also since Mizuki will transfer to another school. However, when Mizuki reveals that she will not transfer, the entire gang, including Akihisa, are relieved."

During the exam Himeji Mizuki faints from a fever and she is sent to the infirmary making her score in the exam a zero. Akihisa Yoshii discovers he is going into the worst class (Class F) and there he encounters Minami, Hideyoshi, Yuuji, and Kouta, who have all known Akihisa for years. Akihisa then makes fun of Minami's bust making a disturbance in the classroom. During the introductions, Mizuki arrives late to class F and happily discovers that Akihisa is also in class F. She then tells him that since she left the test ill she received a score zero aand thus was sent to Class F. Angered by this, Akihisa decides that he will attempt to send Mizuki to her correct classroom (Class A). To do this he consults Yuuji, telling him that they must declare a ESB war on class A, but his purpose is different. Yuuji decides to first declare war to class E, and he sends Akihisa to declare it (making the other class severely beat him up). As the battle starts, Minami, who is good at math, decides to take the front along with Hideyoshi and Voyeur. Akihisa stays with Yuuji. Meanwhile, Mizuki is taking a recovery test to earn points to bring her test score up from zero. When Minami is cornered by the representative of Class E, she too goes to take a recovery test and finds Mizuki solving questions rapidly. When Class E has defeated all of class F's students except Akihisa, Yuuji, and the girls, Yuuji then tells Akihisa to fight them, saying to show them his \"true power\" as the \"Punishment Inspector\". However, Akihisa's results prove to be useless and comical. Then Mizuki (and Minami) arrive, with Mizuki showing a score on a par with a class A score and easily takes out all of class E students. Yuuji then decides to not switch classroom facilities with the defeated Class E, saying he prefers to have Class E indebted to Class F. The episode finishes with Mizuki"

                    "SummaryEnglish": "Yūji and Shōko reminisce of an elementary school (5th grade) memory. Yūji, at the time, was considered a genius, surpassing 6th graders, and was very overconfident and selfish. A trio of jealous 6th graders try to blackmail Yūji by writing \"I cheated on all of my tests\" on his P.E. uniform. Shōko, already in love with Yūji, tries to stop them. However, she fails and is bullied. Yūji notices them, and decides to save Shōko, by fighting the 6th graders. Later that day, Yūji comes home beaten, and Shōko explains to his mother. Yūji's mother then lets little Shōko know that she is rooting for Shōko to gain Yūji's love."

Being embarrassed by students a year lower than them some time ago, Tsunemura and Natsukawa somewhat thought of a little way to get some payback. The system in the school, already being a little broken again for the third time, gave their principal an idea to give the students a way to settle their little fight. They decided to have a little RPG like game, on where a pair of two each time enters areas where they have to defeat the enemies en route to the final destination. The episode ends with an unfinished game and Tsunemura confessing to Hideyoshi, who refuses."
