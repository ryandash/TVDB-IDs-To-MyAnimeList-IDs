    "SummaryEnglish": "Thirty years ago a strange phenomenon called \"spacequake\" devastated the center of Eurasia, claiming the lives of at least 150 million people. Since then, smaller spacequakes plague the world on an irregular basis. Shido Itsuka, a seemingly ordinary high schooler comes across a mysterious girl at the ground zero of a spacequake and learns from his sister Kotori she is one of the \"Spirits\" who are the real cause of the spacequakes that occur when they manifest themselves in the world. He also learns that Kotori is the commander of the airship Fraxinus, crewed by the organization Ratatoskr, and is recruited to make use of his mysterious ability to seal the Spirits' powers thus stopping them from being a threat to mankind. However, there is a catch: to seal to Spirit's power, I must make it fall in love with him and kiss her.",

Some time later, Shido has a date in the arcade with Tohka and when he asks to take a picture with her, she refuses and enters the photo cabin by herself instead, giving him a picture of hers that she claims is for his eyes only. Back at the school, the other students accidentally see the picture, which turns out to be a photo of a revealing Tohka, as the only photo she ever took was during a medical examination and believed Shido wanted a similar one, much to his chagrin."
