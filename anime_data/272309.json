The freshman are all in classes when Imaizumi comes in and tells them he just learned from the second years that the Inter High Preliminaries started that morning. Onoda, Naruko, and Imaizumi rush an hour away to the prelim site and find that Sohoku is in 3rd place, 50 seconds behind two other teams, with only two laps remaining. Instead of panicking, Tadokoro tells the first years to keep a close eye out as Sohoku will take the race by a full minute. Sohoku unleashes their specialty human bullet train attack and goes into first place by a full minute with one lap remaining. As Naruko and Imaizumi try to figure out how they can defeat the 3rd years. Kinjo comes up and says they plan on releasing the first years at the main Inter High competition if they can endure a special training camp. The following day Hakone learns the results and swears to crush their rivals. However one member of the team, Manami, has chosen to skip the meeting and is found taking a ride through the mountains, wondering if his class rep is going to be angry when he shows up late.",

While waiting Onoda decides to get some water until he realizes he has left his wallet in the van. Manami arrives shortly after and offers him his water bottle. Instead of taking his water bottle back, Manami tells Onoda to keep it. When Onoda arrives at the camp, Kinjo breaks out special training for the first and second years that are there. They must complete 1000km to be eligible to participate in the Inter High within 4 days time. However adjustments have been made to Naruko's, Imaizumi's, and Onoda's bikes. Naruko must complete the 1000km without his lower handle bars. Imaizumi must complete the 1000km without his gear shifters. Onoda isn't told what his special training is, but old heavy tires have been subbed out on his bike that will force him to adjust his cycling style. These 3 seniors, 2 second years (Teshima and Aoyagi), and Sugimoto also participate in the special training, all without any modifications to their bikes. With a little help from Makishima, Onoda is able to learn how it'll be easier for him to ride, but the changes give Onoda a large deficit in terms of laps covered, and he's not sure he'll be able to master the training before time runs out.",

Captain Kinjou and Makishima try to follow, but every time Kinjou tries to put pressure on his legs they seem to give out. Onoda realizes something is wrong and decides to come up and talk to him. Kinjou realizes he doesn't have to be the ace, because they all work together as a team. Kinjou decides to make up a new plan on the spot. He sends Onoda, Imazumi, and Naruko to climb the mountain with Makishima. Only two orders are given: 1) Naruko is to be more flashy and 2) one of them must take the jersey across the finish line first. Afterwards Kinjou is forced to drop out. Onoda initially takes the lead, but Naruko moves to the front to show off his new sprint climb. Further back Tadokoro reveals to Shinkai that their red spring bean is the most dangerous teammate of all because he has yet to have shown his full sprinters spirit, and that time could very well come on the final climb.",

Naruko refuses to give up the lead and focuses solely on the road, where he can see the white line, but he can't see anything else. Onoda decides to help but giving Naruko directions on the turns. As Sohoku catches up to Hakone Naruko slowly but surely drops back, and in the end he crashes to the side of the road unable to continue on. The last we hear are Onoda's and Imaizumi's screams for their fallen friend, but the two decide to honor what he has done and help take down Hakone.",

Imaizumi declares that he is the new ace and he will take first. Onoda is shocked and asks Makishima if it's ok. Makishima says it is fine because he and Toudou would never let the other finish in first as the ace. Imaizumi then decides to get reckless and move ahead on his own. Makishima keeps Toudou at bay and forces Fukutomi to pursue him. Everytime Fukutomi catches up Imaizumi puts on another burst of speed. We see how Imaizumi became addicted to road racing and how he first met the Kanzaki's. Finally we see Imaizumi thinking to himself and knowing he can win if nothing else changes. However a medical van is further back on the road. It picks up Naruko and has him withdraw from the race. They then clear the road because more racers are coming. Ishigaki collapses and then tells Midosuji to press on at full strength and he will win. An ominious wind then begins to blow as Midosuji begins to ascend the final 15km on his own.",

The proposal that both agree to is that the loser of their individual race cannot cross the finish line before the winner.

Toudou asks Makashima why he has such faith in Onoda, and Makashima reveals that Onoda has never once failed to obey an order that has been given to him. He thinks back to Onoda's many races- the uphill climb on his mommy bike, the first year race, the 1000km race against the second years, and even his catch-ups at the Inter-High. With roughly 7km left Onoda catches up to Midosuji and Manami. He vows to not let Midosuji catch up to the aces.

This gives Manami the chills, and he tells Fukutomi that Onoda is the bigest threat there. Meanwhile Imazumi decides to change Onoda's job. He tells him their job is to cross the finish line together to win for Sohoku. Midosuji decides to try and sprint ahead, but Imazumi matches his pace and refuses to let him get ahead.
