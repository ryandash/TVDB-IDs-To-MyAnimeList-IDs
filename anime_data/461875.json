  "SummaryEnglish": "The series, which will be the first in Precure history to be released solely via YouTube and social media, will be a dialogue-less series featuring appearances from the franchise's many mascots. A 30-second trailer gives us a little peek at the animation style, showing mascots from across the show's many dimensions playing together in a cozy town of their own.",
