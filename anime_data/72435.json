The garden that he takes her to is at the back of their house but unfortunately, it's overgrown with weeds and most of the flowers are dead due to neglect. Rumina promises Ruri that he will take her to as many gardens as she wants. In the meantime, the bad guy that we saw in the first episode, Seki, has found Chelsea and Ruri. Chelsea first defeats all of Seki's soldiers but this has sapped her strength. At a crucial moment in her fight with Seki, she ran out of gravity power. Seki surrounds her in a high-burning ring of fire, intending to suffocate her. Rumina challenges Seki but was killed in one blow. Ruri decides that it's all her fault and uses her abilities as the Shrine Maiden of Life to cast a spiritual summoning and restore Rumina's life. Once revived, Rumina appears to have also gained the power to manipulate wind. He sends Seki flying and the latter decides to take off, but not before warnin"

Ruri replies that they should at least do the sweeping since they're freeloaders. Chelsea decides to help out but gets frustrated when the wind keeps blowing fallen flower pedals away. She decides to use her gravity power but it just ends up making all of the flower pedals on the tree fall to the ground. In the meantime, Rumina and Ginnosuke rush off to school. The gangster individuals pay a short visit to Rumina's temple (remember those guys that got beaten up in the first episode?). They are quickly driven off by Chelsea though. Ruri becomes interested in school and wants to go. Chelsea is originally against it but then relents. Ruri, Rumina and Ginnosuke pay a midnight visit to school grounds. Rumina and Ginnosuke explain to Ruri how school stuff works (e.g.: attendance); Chelsea arrives late. On top of the school building, Ruri admires the moon (she didn't know what it was at first)"
