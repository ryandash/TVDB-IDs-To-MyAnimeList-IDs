  "SummaryEnglish": "The story of Yo,a Japnese artist who is kidnapped by the Hong Kong-based 108 Dragons and re-educated to become an assassin, has the twist that while he's an almost perfect killer,he still has enough conscience left in his otherwise re-programmed brain that he sheds tears whenever he kills. His encounter of Emu,a bright,sensitive yet lonely 29 year-old virgin becomes far too difficult of an assignment for him when his compassion for her(inspired by seeing a vision of himself coming to kill her that SHE'S painted)combines with his attraction for her. Soon,she becomes an unwitting and yet willing tag-along on his missions,as he seeks to un-fetter himself from his mental prison.",
