  "TitleEnglish": "\"Deji\" Meets Girl",
  "SummaryEnglish": "Follows the adventures of Maise Higa, a 16 year old high school student who is pressed into helping out as a part-time front desk clerk at her family's hotel in Okinawa. What seems like a boring way to spend her summer break takes a strange turn with the arrival of \"Ichiro Suzuki\", a guest from the mainland who brings weird phenomena with him, such as fish floating in midair and an enormous banyan tree sprouting through the roof of the hotel. \"Deji\" is an Okinawan word that means \"troublesome\" or \"a lot\".",
