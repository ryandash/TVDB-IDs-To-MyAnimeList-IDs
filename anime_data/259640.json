Kirito, who beta-tested the game, logs-in to the world of Aincrad and meets Klein, a new player, who asks him to teach him the basics of the game including the Sword Skill battle system. Later, after several hours in the game, Kirito and Klein discover that they cannot log out. Shortly after, the pair are teleported to the town square, where they see that all other players have also been transported to the location. A red-hooded Game Master then appears in the sky and reveals himself to the crowd as Akihiko Kayaba, the game's creator. He tells them that he intentionally removed the log-out option. He cautions that they cannot log-out by simply removing the NerveGear, the VR helmet they use to log-in the game, as it will kill them instantly. The only way to log out is for the players to beat and clear all 100 floors of the game. Should they die in the game, their real bodies will perish as well. As a parting gift, Akihiko gives them a mirror that alters their in-game avatars to resemble their real appearance. Kirito asks Klein to follow him to the next town to level up before resources are depleted, but Klein politely declines as he wishes to remain with his friends. Kirito then heads out, vowing to be free from the game. By the end of the first month, 2,000 players have died and the 1st floor has yet to be cleared.",

Kirito agrees while hiding the fact he is at least Level 40, twice higher than the others as they slowly and safely level up at low-level floors that have been cleared. Kirito bonds with his new friends, especially Sachi, who admits to Kirito she's afraid to die which he assures her he will protect her and they will be free one day. But on June 12, 2023, as Keita goes to buy a house for the guild, against their usual methods and Kirito's advice, the Black Cats decide to earn some money by going to the upper floors where they set off a trap, locking them in a room with higher level Mobs. Kirito desperately tries to save his friends but they are killed one by one until Sachi is the last to fall. Blaming himself over his friends death, including Keita, who committed suicide upon learning what happen, Kirito goes on a suicidal quest upon learning a rumor there is a way to revive the dead. On December 24, 2023, Argo the informant reveals to Kirito the location of a special boss named Nicholas the Renegade who has an item that can revive the dead. As Kirito heads there, he is followed by Klein and his guild, who fears for his safety. They are soon surrounded by the Holy Dragon Alliance guild who are also after the item. As Klein and his guild hold off the Holy Dragons, Kirito faces against Nicholas alone. But much to his distraught, Kirito discovers the item can only revive the dead within ten seconds after their deaths. To Kirito's surprise, he receives a recorded message from Sachi. Sent to him on Christmas Eve in the event of her death, Sachi tells Kirito not to blame himself over her death and that he should continue living to be free from the game. As sh",

Eugene does not believe him and challenges him to a duel claiming that he may trust his word should he manage to hold himself for thirty seconds. Kirito is severely punished by Eugene's sword which can bypass his defenses, until he conjures a huge smokescreen, making use of it to steal Leafa's sword and turn the tides of the battle fighting Eugene with two swords. After Eugene is defeated, he is revived by Sakuya and leaves in peace with his army. Having his treason exposed, Sigurd is contacted by Sakuya who strips him of his title and has him banished from the Sylph territory. After learning that the now allied Sylphs and Cait Siths plan an incursion to the World Tree in a couple of days, Kirito donates a large sum of money to aid in their war effort and departs ahead with Leafa.

Kirito then brings up the idea that Death Gun could have used his mantle to spy on other players without being noticed.

          "SummaryEnglish": "The battle between Death Gun and Kirito begins as the former unleashes a deadly barrage of strikes that greatly weakens Kirito. While they are fighting, Kirito has a flashback to the meeting before the Laughing Coffin raid in Sword Art Online, recalling a strikingly similar player with the same red eyes as Death Gun. Kirito deduces that Death Gun is really the infamous, \"Red Eyed,\" Xaxa, the second in command of Laughing Coffin. As Xaxa goes for the final blow, Sinon creates the illusion of a direction line using her experience in the game alone, causing Xaxa to cloak to avoid it. However, Kirito pulls out his sidearm and fires it at Xaxa, stopping the cloaking process and rendering him vulnerable. Using the willpower and strength he possessed in Sword Art Online, Kirito defeats Xaxa, cutting in clean in half. Before he dies, Xaxa reassures Kirito that their battle is not over. Sinon and Kirito then come to an agreement to end the Bullet of Bullets by committing double in-game suicide using a grenade, crowning them both the winner, but not before they reveal to each other their real names. After logging out, Shino is visited by Shinkawa, who, after making romantic advances on her, pulls out a syringe and reveals himself to be the second person involved in the Death Gun murders, which Kirito and Sinon earlier deduced while in the cave. Shinkawa tries to rape Shino, but she is able to get away, only to have Shinkawa pull her back. As this is happening, Kazuto bursts through Shino's door and attacks Shinkawa, holding him off while telling Shino, who recognizes Kazuto as Kirito, to run.",

Shino then checks on Kazuto's condition, but found out that there is an electrode stuck at the part of his chest where Kyouji had attempted to inject him with the drug which protects him against the needless syringe. Several days later, Endou calls out to Shino, who again tried to demand money from her. As Shino refuses the demand, Endou took out a model gun and threatens Shino. However, after Endou unsuccessfully attempts to fire with it, Shino took the gun from Endou, shows her that the safeties needed to be disabled to fire and then shoots a can with it before returning it back to Endou. As Shino was about to leave the school grounds, she saw that Kazuto was waiting for her near the entrance and drawing unwanted attention. Kazuto first drives Shino to a cafe to meet with Kikuoka Seijirou about the Death Gun incident. After that, Kazuto takes Shino to the Dicey Cafe, where he introduces her to Yuuki Asuna and Shinozaki Rika (Lisbeth). Kazuto then reveals that he had told the two girls about Shino's past and explains that he had them help him find a certain person that she should meet. The person is revealed to have been a woman, named Oosawa Sachie, who was the post office worker, threatened by the robber that Shino killed. The woman thanks Shino for saving her life and tells her that she was pregnant at the time, so Shino had also saved the life of her daughter, Mizue. Kazuto then explains that he wants Shino to think about the people that she had saved by killing the robber and thus be able to forgive herself for it.",

Without delay, he called Asuna, Klein, Lisbeth, Silica and Sinon to challenge the dungeon in the sky of Jötunheimr, where Excaliber was . After preparing their items at Lisbeth's arms shop and purchasing potions for the adventure, the group entered Jötunheimr via a secret passageway in Alne. At the end of the tunnel, they reached the top of Jötunheimr and Leafa called Tonkii, a flying evil-god-class monster that they had befriended several months ago. The group climbed on Tonkii's back and asked it to ferry them to the ice dungeon. However, along the way, Tonkii suddenly dived and stopped at an altitude where they could see the ground. There they saw that players were cooperating with the humanoid evil-god-class monsters to massacre Tonkii's kin, the beast evil-god-class monsters. As they were watching the scene, a giant NPC, the «Queen of the Lake» Urðr, appeared behind them. The NPC explained that the massacre was ordered by the king of the giants, Þrym, who once threw the Holy Sword Excaliber into Urðr's Spring and caused the world of Jötunheimr to turn into an icy wasteland. She then explained that if all of Tonkii's kin were slaughtered, she would lose her power and this would allow Þrym to invade the land of the fairies, Alfheim. To prevent this, Urðr requested the fairies to retrieve the Holy Sword Excaliber from the bottom of the ice dungeon, called Þrymheimr.",

With Kirito revealing his new technique of using consecutive Sword Skills with each of his swords to avoid the period of rigidity, they are able to defeat the two minotaurs. Later, after defeating the boss guarding the entrance to the lowest floor of the castle, they encounter an NPC woman trapped in an ice cage along the way.

Just as he is about to finish them off, the uninjured Sinon distracts Thrym while the other search for a large golden hammer purported by Freyja to belong to her family, which is essential in defeating him. Kirito finds the hammer and throws it to Freyja, who catches it and then suddenly transforms into Thor, the Norse god of thunder, to everyone's shock. Thor, enraged at Thrym for stealing his hammer, then joins the group in the fight against Thrym. Eventually, they manage to overwhelm him before Thor finishes him off. As a reward for aiding him in Thrym's defeat, Thor grants Klein with Mjölnir, much to his dissatisfaction. A secret staircase then opens up, which leads the group to the bottom of Þrymheimr, and Excaliber. Kirito manages to pull it out of the frozen puddle, but it causes Þrymheimr to fall apart. As the floor they are on plunges down a chasm, they are saved by Tonkii, and Kirito, knowing that Excaliber is too heavy for Tonkii to carry with everyone else throws it down the chasm, but Sinon retrieves it with a magic-assisted arrow. She gives Excaliber back to Kirito under the condition that he remember her every time he uses the sword. The group then observes as the chasm is flooded with water and the World Tree's roots extend to its surface, causing new trees to grow. Urðr and her sisters Verdandi and Skuld appear and thank them for saving Jötunheimr, and Urðr gifts Kirito with Excaliber.

Siune explains that the group wanted to defeat the boss in order to etch their names on the Monument of Swordsmen, as they would not be able to adventure together after winter.

After an unpleasant conversation with her mother, Asuna heads to a park in another residential area. There, she considers calling Kazuto, but decides that she did not want to expose her weakness to him. The next day, she meets up with the Sleeping Knights and they easily manage to reach the boss room, but Asuna detects several other players hiding near there. Though the players claim they are waiting for their friends, Asuna realizes they were actually spying on their battle to study the boss without sacrificing their own men. After the Sleeping Knights and Asuna are defeated and re-spawn in Ronbaru, Asuna tells the others what she discovered and they decide to rush to the boss room again before the guild had enough time to gather a raid group. At the boss room, they find a large amount of players gathered at the door. As the guild rejects the request of the Sleeping Knights to let them try again, Yuuki declares that they would fight it out and attacks the raid group's leader.

However, he used «Deadly Sins» to break all seven projectiles. As the reinforcements got into formation for battle, Kirito told Asuna that he would hold them off for three minutes with the help of Klein. In the meantime, the Sleeping Knights engaged the guild's forces blocking the path to the boss room. But, seeing that their assault was rendered useless by the intervention of the guild's healers, Asuna asked Siune to manage the healing herself and used «Flashing Penetrator» to break through to the healers, while killing the group's leader. After the healers were disposed of, the remained of the players were easily defeated, allowing Asuna and the others to enter the boss room. During the boss battle, Talken's spear was thrown into the air by the boss and it accidentally hit a crystal where the boss's two heads connected. Seeing that this caused the boss to assume a guard stance, Asuna deduced that it might be its weak point and tested it out by firing several ice pillars at the same spot. Confirming her deduction, Asuna left the healing to Siune to tell Yuuki to use a Sword Skill at the weak spot. Following Asuna's suggestion to use Tecchi as a stepping stone, Yuuki defeated the boss with her signature Original Sword Skill. After the battle, the group agreed to celebrate at Asuna's player home. While conversing about various things, Asuna asked whether she could join the Sleeping Knights, but, seeing that it resulted in an unpleasant reaction, she decided to change the topic and reminded everyone about the Monument of Swordsmen. At the monument, everyone took a picture and Yuuki accidentally called Asuna as her elder sister. Since she had also done the same in the boss room, Asuna pointed this out to Yuuki.
