    "SummaryEnglish": "While testing out his camera on a bridge one summer night, Kaito sees a blue light streaking across the sky, only to be blown off the railing seconds later. Just before succumbing to unconsciousness, a hand reaches down to grab ahold of his own. He woke up the next morning wondering how he ended up back in his own room with no injuries or any recollection of the night before. As he proceeds with his normal school life, Kaito and his friends discuss what to do with his camera, finally deciding to make a film with it over the summer break. Noticing that Kaito has an interest in the new upperclassmen Ichika Takatsuki, his friend Tetsurou decides to invite her, as well as her friend Remon Yamano, to join them in their project. In what becomes one of the most entertaining and exciting summers of their lives, Kaito and his friends find that their time spent together is not just about creating a film, but something much more meaningful that will force them to confront their true feelings.",

He sees a hand grabbing his as he fell, bloodied, only to wake up in his futon the next day. At his school, a transfer student named Ichika Takatsuki comes to a third year class.

Nanami gets to know Ichika, and out of nervousness the latter almost reveals that she is an alien, but manages to convince them that she is a foreign student. Listening to her story, Nanami lets her move in with them, since she will be away for quite some time, and she was looking for someone to take care of Kaito. Kanna was surprised to hear it, even thinking it to be some sort of a wedding arrangement in exasperation. After seeing Nanami off the next day, and right after shopping for clothes for Ichika, Kaito finds Lemon, Tetsurō, Mio and Kanna inside the house--to talk about the movie project."

Kanna had to leave Kaito when she finds out Lemon has been filming their \"date.\" It so happened that Ichika crosses paths with Kaito. Nervous of the prospect that she wants to talk to him, he runs away from her, and a chase ensues. It was all about a misunderstanding--that Kaito wants to know Ichika's secret, while Ichika wants to know who dumped Kaito. When Kaito took some footage of Ichika, it turned out into some sort of an informal confession. Shocked, Kaito stops filming her."

Worried about what will happen next, Ichika enters and tries to take him home...though not without clashing a bit with Manami, acting like an overprotective lover, until Tetsurō comes to clear things up, that Manami is already married, and she's here because of a petty quarrel with her husband. As an apology Ichika asked Kaito for a favor from him. He asked if she could help him review for the finals, to which she agreed, and helped him study until the final day of exams."

That evening, Tetsurō, after meeting an uneasy home-bound Kanna, sneaks into Kaito's room, and tells him that she, his childhood friend, is in love with him. Ichika overhears the conversation."

During the test Rinon appears to Ichika, telling that an emergency beacon has been activated. True enough, a League lifeboat (a rescue drone) comes to rescue her (it's more of taking her by force), but Ichika says she has still a lot to do. Then again, when Kaito hears Ichika scream, he rushed to where she is, abandoning his partner Kanna. Even with the help of Rinna, one of Ichika's machines, Kaito dies rescuing \"the one he loves.\" Ichika, however, manages to reverse Kaito's death. Kaito awakens and sees himself with Ichika inside a ball of light, and mysteriously returning to the same spot. Everyone catches up to the two and sees Ichika incessantly apologizing in front of Kaito."

However, with the rather rough \"rescue attempt\" by The League rescue drone, she believes that another will come to investigate, and fears that her days on Earth are numbered; thus shunning Kaito for awhile--and sealing her feelings for him. This irritated Kanna, telling Ichika that \"looking for that place\" is just an excuse to avoid him. Kanna confessed that she has feelings for Kaito, and runs away after confronting Ichika--only to be consoled later by Tetsurō, hurting Mio in the process. Kaito, with a bit of encouragement from Lemon, did confess to Ichika later--and, when Kaito said it's his first kiss, she revealed that she has kissed Kaito four times already, as she gave him the fifth one."

Angry at himself, Tetsurō kicks a nearby wooden railing and injures himself. The next day Tetsurō invites Kanna to their old playground as kindergarten kids and confesses to her, but she rejects him; and as she runs off to Kaito's place to confess (only to be rejected by Kaito anyway), Tetsurō falls on his knees, where Mio sneaks from behind and hugs him, saying it's alright to cry.

Learning certain information from Emika, Remon tells them that Ichika may stay if the earthly spot Ichika has seen in her imagination is found in order to prove a probable previous contact between aliens and human beings. As the group finds the place, the search team arrives and starts a pursuit. Since Rinon's teleport function becomes disabled, Remon takes the others to the spot using a van specially prepared with Emika's help; with Tetsuro, Mio, and Kanna becoming bio-signature decoys for the pursuing rescue craft.
