  "SummaryEnglish": "The story is set in a world where ghosts have also inhabited the Internet, following the tradition that ghosts linger on in places where they have strong attachments. The story centers on a Sōji Enoshiro, a 15-year-old boy who also streams under the handle \"Aoringo.\" He streams deliberately violent, clickbaity, and provocative content to get reactions and earn money, but it is all for the cause of taking care of his younger sister's medical bills. In real life, he is a simple boy who only loves to eat pudding and loves his sister, whom he would go to hell and back for. One time, while online, he is attacked by a ghost who resides in the online world, and it leaves him spiritually awakened. He is recruited by Miden Academy, a school specializing in training exorcists who tackle the digital realm.",
