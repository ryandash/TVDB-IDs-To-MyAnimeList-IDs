Getting soaked is the least of one man's troubles, however, as he is fleeing from something that has him visibly shaken. One wrong turn down an alley, and the man becomes a bloody crime scene, courtesy of a towering, shadowy figure. Two detectives converge on the alley to collect evidence, but they're interrupted by four females belonging to AMP (the Attacked Mystification Police Department), a division of the Tokyo police force. Judging from how they are greeted by the two male cops, their organization doesn't command much respect from others in the department. AMP is there because they specialize in destroying the Lucifer Hawk, the perpetrator of this crime and a life form discovered at the turn of the century that feeds on humans. Unfortunately, the creature is still around, and emerges from through a wall ready for another meal. Something, however, captures its attention and it takes off in pursuit. What the Lucifer Hawk s",

Expecting a smooth landing, Katsumi instead notices the Lucifer Hawk that sensed her arrival to the city standing on the wing of her plane. She awakens to burning pieces of the aircraft -- and to the creature as well, which chases her down and corners her. The members of AMP arrive just in time, but their efforts to control the Lucifer Hawk are for the most part ineffective. Katsumi then calls upon a power she herself didn't realize she had, and destroys the creature. Cheyenne arrives shortly afterwards to explain as much as she can. Though information concerning the threat she just faced is scarce, it is known that there are three types of Lucifer Hawks. Category one is the most plentiful but least intelligent, and category two is somewhat smarter, and cap",

By the time two officers reach her room, a category-three Lucifer Hawk has already shown Katsumi secrets from her past. What she learns is apparently interesting enough to make her go to police headquarters with her two AMP bodyguards. While there, she again meets up with the creature that offered her a glimpse into her past. To the dismay of AMP, she seemingly decides to join him in their world, a place called Nemesis. She ultimately rejects the creature, but she'll have some backup against his future wrath, as she finally accepts AMP's invitation to join their elite force. There's only one small problem -- she was a secretary in Hawaii only days earlier, and her utter lack of skill clearly shows through. To ensure her improvement, AMP brings in a talented bu",

Though they crash land in the most dangerous part of the city, Katsumi is able to carry her injured and unconscious partner to safety, barely eluding a gang of masked criminals with a particularly strong hatred for cops. The sergeant never thought she'd get as far as she did, which can only mean that her training is complete. Unfortunately, his problem with authority may have rubbed off on Katsumi, because she disobeys orders and runs off from the rest of the group to confront a category two Lucifer Hawk on her own. When she's confronted by Cheyenne she makes things worse by saying that she thought she could fight the creature by herself. This enrages her boss and alienates her teammates, who consi",

Though she truly believed she was capable of confronting a Lucifer Hawk on her own, the only thanks she receives comes in the form of a stern reprimand from Rally Cheyenne and a cold shoulder from the others. How does Katsumi respond? By again striking out on her own to chase down a Lucifer Hawk. This time, however, she walks right into an ambush and is quickly surrounded by far more of the creatures than she can possibly handle on her own. Yuki, the only AMP member who has made any effort to get to know Katsumi, has just finished a long heart-to-heart talk with her, so she's luckily close enough to send out a distress signal. Thanks to some persuasive words from Yuki, Katsumi finally earns the friendship of all the AMP members. Fighting side-by-side against a Lucifer Hawk proves to be quite a bonding experience as well.

She needn't be embarrassed for very long, however, as attention shifts toward Nami Yamigumo's shocking revelation that she never even thinks about having a boyfriend. Nami usually keeps her feelings bottled up, but this statement is far too interesting not to investigate further. Unfortunately, any probe into her personal life will have to wait, as Nami's sister unexpectedly arrives at AMP headquarters with the intention of brining her home. At her grandfather's request, Nami is to take a leave of absence from her police duties so that he may pass on to her a sacred sword in a ceremony naming her as heir to the powerful and revered Yamigumo clan.",

At the last possible second, Katsumi uses her dagger to wound her unsuspecting assailant, but she is herself badly injured as a result and must be hospitalized. Katsumi's father brought the Lucifer Hawk into this world, which is why they feel it's her responsibility to open the gates of Nemesis for them.

A strange voice in her head, however, prompts Katsumi to leave behind the AMP protective barrier that surrounds the building, an action that places her in grave danger. Surprisingly, the voice does not belong to the Lucifer Hawk, but rather to Grosspoliner, the mystical sword that once belonged to her father. Freeing Grosspoliner from the tower that has served as its prison since the turn of the century, Katsumi finds both a new companion and a powerful ally in the battle against the Lucifer Hawks. Katsumi is eventually healthy enough to return to active duty, but it's her life outside of work that's now in shambles, as she learns that her apartment has been destroyed.
