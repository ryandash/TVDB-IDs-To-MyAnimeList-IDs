            "SummaryEnglish": "The story begins in the Spirit World, where the River Styx is overflowing, due to a tsunami. But as Koenma looks out his window he can tell this is no ordinary storm. The floodwaters continue to rise, and just before they become too much for Koenma he gives a mysterious item to Botan, and tells her to give it to Yusuke Urameshi. But Botan gets hurt badly and barely makes it to Yusuke. Botan is too weak to give Yusuke the item. Throughout most of the movie she’s unconscious and is unable to do anything, while a great evil is surfacing. The storm was apparently caused by the forces of the Netherworld, which was banished into cold space ages ago. All this happens pretty quickly, and so does the fighting. We get to see Yusuke and the others do their signature attacks, against some of their toughest opponents yet. To restore balance in the now flooded Spirit world, Yusuke and the others must track down five spots on Earth that contain a large amount of spiritual energy. But their simple plans get turned upside down when the ruler of the Netherworld, Yakumo, and his three henchmen decide to use the same energy for evil. So, the race begins to save the Spirit World, and now the Human World as well.",

Rinku, in retaliation, fires his Yo-Yos again, but Kuwabara shows that he learned how to manoeuvre his Spirit Sword. Both warriors are knocked out of the ring, since both attacks strike home. The announcer says that the fighters can only stay out of the ring for ten seconds, and begins the count. Rinku comes up after five, and Yusuke, still presumably sleeping, shouts for Kuwabara to wake up. Kuwabara gets mad, and gets up and confronts Yusuke. Just then, Rinku stops from healing himself and causes his Yo-Yos to squeeze Kuwabara, preventing him from jumping back in the ring. The announcer finishes the count, and Rinku is awarded the first win. After a moment, the second match begins: Roto vs. Kurama. Kurama goes on the offensive, but as he is about to deal a finishing blow, Roto quickly reveals his dirty trick: a device that, when activated, will tell his demon brother to kill Kurama's mother. As Kurama isn't willing to put his mother's life on the line, he is forced to stop his attacks, and allows Roto to beat him up. When Roto grows bored of the torment, and raises his foot and tells Kurama to lick the slime off, though, Kurama declines, and Roto threatens to press the button. Surprisingly, Kurama tells him to go ahead and press it. Roto raises his arm, when suddenly he finds himself unable to move. Kurama reveals that he threw a \"Death Seed\" in Roto, that will bloom from his body in a few instants. Roto pleads him mercy, to which Kurama simply replies \"no\".

            "SummaryEnglish": "This episode begins with the duel between Hiei and Shigure (the one who gave Hiei his Jagan). Hiei has a flashback to his early. In the Ice World, he was thrown off a cliff because he was \"the Forbidden Child\". He was found by a demon clan. They were fascinated by Hiei teargem from the Ice World. He made a name for himself as a ruthless killer. Eventually, Hiei left the clan of demons. He went to Shigure for the Jagan eye. He wanted the eye to find the Ice World and the teargem, which was cut off of his neck during a fight. Shigure refused to give Hiei the eye because he did not think Hiei could endure the pain. Hiei proves he is worthy by sticking his katana through his own hand. After the operation, Shigure asked Hiei to stay because the operation drained all of his spirit energy. Hiei agrees, figuring he will never see the surgeon again. The duel begins. Shigure throws his circle sword/boomerang at Hiei. Hiei blocks the sword, losing his left arm in the process. Shigure recovers and cuts Hiei.",
