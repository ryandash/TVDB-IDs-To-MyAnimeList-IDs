When they fearfully take that baby, the \"lion\" suddenly flies away. Though puzzling, Amami couple are happy to accept that baby as their own child. Eight years later, the time is 2005 A.D. Without notice, a Zonder appear at the Tokyo Bay, merging with debris and a passing ship which have kids on its deck, advancing to Shinjyuku - the center of Tokyo. The Japanese Self-Defense Forces' conventional weapon has no effect and some kids are taken hostage. But there is the hero who stands against that Zonder Robot. His name is Guy the Cyborg, the commander of GGG's Mechanized Unit. The GGG (\"Gutsy Geoid Guard\") are the newly-made Japanese secret defense forces against the extraterrestrial invasion.",

Papillon was the only human duplicate that was stable enough to survive for more than a few seconds. The Galeon and Mamoru previously met were also Pas-Q Machine duplicates.",

Papillon begins work on an antidote, while Mikoto goes to find the imprisoned Soldato J, now mankind's last hope. In the process, she meets the real Mamoru, who had been in the Trinary Solar System for a year and a half. Upon meeting and freeing J (with the help of Renais), Mikoto is attacked by the Sol Masters Pillnus and Pia Decem, respectively Renais and J's counterparts. The heroes escape on the reborn J-Ark, which is dragged up into the upper atmosphere and forced to do battle with replicants of the entire Mobile Unit and a replica of GaoFighGar piloted by none other than Guy, now under Palparepa's control.",

The battles end up spread across the entire Repli-Earth, and Genesic GaoGaiGar's fight with Palparepa is shown to be very one-sided until Palparepa powers up by injecting himself with his own Doping Cylinders.

Each member of the Mobile Unit uses their desperation attack, most of which were formerly only listed in tech specs, and emerges victorious. Guy manages to defeat the powered-up Palparepa even after he undergoes yet another transformation, and reveals that the G-Stones convert courage into life force. Against this power, the Loud G-Stones that power the Masters lose their strength. The Masters' Regeneration Machine, controlled by Pisa Sol, proceeds to duplicate all the destroyed Masters a hundred times over. This temporarily drains its stored power, giving GGG the opportunity they need to use their ultimate weapon, the Goldion Crusher, to destroy it and thus end the menace of the Masters. Unfortunately, GGG is faced with the discovery that this Repli-jin universe is collapsing, and the only chance for escape lies with J-Ark's two remaining ES Missiles. In the end, Mamoru and Kaidou are sent in out of the system, bidding tearful farewells to their comrades. Upon their return to Earth, Mamoru, Kaidou and Hana create a memorial to honor GGG's sacrifice.",
