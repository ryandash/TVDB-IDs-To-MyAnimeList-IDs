City officials, including the governor, are planning to put a stop to the Mafia when suddenly an OrgMan appears on the road in front of them, and kills all of them. Harry controls everything, but still wants more. Bunji is as on-edge as ever, he shoots people who work for him if they slack off even the slightest. OrgMan production is on the up(with Bear and Bob as overseers), but each OrgMan requires a base body of at least a specific athletic talent, and to create Superiors you need a body of the highest caliber(both physically and physiologically) for it to work right. Lee, due to emotional repression at the highest level, has gone inwardly insane, and now has people who don't measure up to the OrgMan status gathered in one room where he can use his new Superior powers to dice them up. Harry continues to visit and bring gifts to the orphanage he bought in episode 14, where the children there call him \"Grandpa Harry\", Sherry looks on at this and still sees only the good in Harry. This is followed by Harry learning that Maria has had a daughter, not wanting to bother with talk of \"the rightful heir\", he ordered his men to take care of it.

Lee jumps Ragnarok at the apparent insult and Ragnarok reveals that Bob's life can be saved by turning him into a Superior, which is an extremely strong OrgMan with will power. However, the process is, at this point, untested, so Lee asks Ragnarok to perfect the formula on Lee to save Bob's life. Cut to present day, with Brandon(still fairly amnesiac) and Mika shopping within the city for food, Mika is slightly disguised by shades and a hat, and she playfully puts a hat on top of Grave to help them blend in.

Mika awakens inside Millennion HQ to the sight Lee and Harry, and she condemns them for their murders. The pair tell Mika she is simply bait for Grave, and Lee points out that upon Grave's arrival, he will kill Mika. Meanwhile, T works on mysterious new ammo for Brandon's guns. Harry and Bear discuss Lee, who has been sent with 150 OrgMen to kill Grave. Bear suggests that Harry slow down, as Millennion's backbone is crumbling and that the OrgMen can't solve all his problems, plus most members on the board don't support Harry's violent actions. Bear declares that if Lee is defeated, he will take on Grave, Harry remains extremely confident in Lee's abilities. While Mika waits in the subway, she asks Lee what her father was like. Lee admits he had a great deal of admiration for BD, it is simply that BD lacked any ambition that bothered Lee. Lee notes that since Harry is now the head of Millennion, its policies have changed with him. By this logic, Lee says that Brandon's actions couldn't have been seen as anything but betrayal, and Lee laughs at the idea that Grave still continues to fight for BD after death, and also at the idea that a former lover is fighting to protect another man's daughter. Mika grows angrier by the moment, but the rumbles from above indicate that Grave has arrived. T speeds to Brandon's locale to presumably deliver the ammunition he was working on earlier. Grave reaches the transit area where Lee and Mika wait, and after putting a blade to Mika's throat, Lee gets Brandon to dispose of his armaments. Lee then asks Grave if he killed Bob, Grave nods and Lee begins the fight.

Harry, meanwhile, attends an emergency meeting called by the top Millennion execs, who are concerned that with the M/KIA of 3/4 of his closest subordinates, they're end is near too. Most of the execs lay their guns down on the table, both Harry and the rebelling execs claim to be taking their actions to protect the Syndicate. An OrgMen appears from a hidden door and slaughters all the execs who laid down their arms, Harry names Bisco as Lee's successor, and parts with Bear for dinner with Sherry. At said dinner, Bear admits that since he has never lived in anything but the Syndicate, that he doesn't see how he can leave, he also, quite seriously, pressures Harry about giving him a granddaughter. Bear soon receives a call on his cell and, much to Sherry's annoyance, departs. Bear appears outside Brandon's hideout, where the Overkills are already in wait, eager to take on orders. Bear dismisses the entire squad, telling them to go on and live their lives, and that Bear himself will take on the target as an individual, and not as a Syndicate member. The members decide to respect his wishes, as Bear's Overkills seem to be the only group within the Syndicate that weren't transformed into OrgMen, per Bear's request.

Ragnarok watches on, horrified, realizing that, in the end, it was Tokioka who was the superior scientist. The city streets are now completely deserted, with the exception of Mika, who stands silent in the middle of a road. Bunji sits quietly on a set of steps overlooking the city, petting and talking to his cat. Harry is pacing within his home, stocking up on munitions while Sherry tries desperately to find out what all the commotion is about. Harry assures Sherry that nothing is wrong, and she looks into Harry's eyes and asks him to promise that he won't die before she does, leaving Sherry all alone in the world. Suddenly, their butler, Harrison, enters the room and draws a gun, apologizing to his master. However, before he can pull the trigger, the Overkills take him down, ever loyal to Bear's daughter. Meanwhile, several of the remaining board members of Millennion are disturbed by the news that their assassination attempt has failed, and thus they try and decide what to do about the OrgMen and Overkills under Harry's control. However, they have now convinced most of the undecided members to join them and they have an ex-employee of Ragnarok building them special anti-OrgMen weaponry. Biscoe, their apparent leader, tells the board to leave Grave alone in his actions.

However, Harry remains comforted by Sherry's body in the passenger seat and the understanding that Harry, himself, has become Millennion. Grave traverses slowly down the street towards his old home in the slums, growing more tired and shattering more severely with each step. Harry, who has located one of the laboratories where OrgMen are created, activates his soldiers to take back Millennion. Meanwhile, Biscoe is examining the new anti-OrgMen bullets which the other Millennion members are distributing to form a mass-scale strike force against the bio-engineered creatures. Harry is seen attending a funeral for Sherry, at which Harry is the sole attendee. Paralleled with images of Harry comforting Sherry, we see Millennion agents taking down the many OrgMan troops around the city. Mika appears at Millennion HQ�s doorstep, obviously looking for Grave but instead finding a group of Millennion agents. But before they try to take her down, Biscoe steps out and intervenes, recognizing her as Big Daddy�s heir. Biscoe tells Mika that, since Harry has become the hunted, she is now free. Mika demands to know what this freedom even means anymore being that so many people had to for it. Biscoe, being that he was a friend of Big Daddy, asks if there�s anything he can do for her.

Harry believes that Brandon hasn’t changed a bit in all these years and asks Brandon why he didn’t kill him back then. Brandon responds that he believed that Harry could become “Millennion.” Harry revels in what he believes to be true, but Brandon tells him that Millennion isn’t just about power and control. Brandon and Harry each see one another as the one who betrayed. Harry pulls out a bottle of bourbon from the year they were born and proposes a toast. Harry realizes that Big Daddy’s words were true, Big Daddy was the original, the whiskey, Harry was only a derivative, bourbon. However, Harry sees Big Daddy as evil as his crimes, but Brandon points out that Big Daddy knew his mistakes and still tried to seek “harmony” in all things. This, Brandon says, is what Millennion is all about. Harry can’t stand Brandon’s loyalty to Big Daddy, and tries to figure out where things all went so wrong. Harry then lays Brandon and Harry’s guns from the elevator sequence, which ended in Brandon’s death, on the table. As they draw their guns at one another, they share a memory of a cloth blowing in the wind, obscuring the sun.
