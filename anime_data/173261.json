Both Agnes and Chelsea agree to join Clan Oasis at the viewing party on the cathedral roof. En route to the cathedral, the party runs into Ritos and Salsa Tortilla, who publicly argue over which will be Leicester's bride, but decline to join the party, claiming to know of a better \"higher\" viewing spot.

Before the rest of the group can catch up with them, Leicester and Carina battle and defeat a crystal monster hiding in the darkness of the rainbow flowers. Carina flies up to retrieve a crystal left in the tree branches and plummets towards earth when her staff suddenly runs out of power. Leicester attempts to break her fall, but the two become entangled in vines and must remain in an indecent position until rescued by the rest of the group.
