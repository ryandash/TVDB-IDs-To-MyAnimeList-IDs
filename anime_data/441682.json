Betrothed since childhood and trained to be queen, she always hoped Prince Clarke would fall for someone else one day. So when he shows up at a ball with another woman, Lettie excitedly retreats to the countryside to start her new life—only for Clarke to appear, determined to win her heart. She wastes no time retreating to an easygoing countryside life, but her newfound peace is cut short when the prince shows up and claims she's still his fiancée! Clarke is determined to win Lettie over and marry her, while Lettie is determined to resist his charms and escape! Who will emerge victorious in this heart-pounding battle of wills?",
