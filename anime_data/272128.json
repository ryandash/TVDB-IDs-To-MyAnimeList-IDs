She then tasks him with seeking a way to allow transit between the real and Elder Tale worlds and relieves the Shibuya party about Krusty's whereabouts. Meanwhile, Nureha and Plant Hwyaden decide to establish relations with Eastal and the Round Table to combat the common Genius threat. Finally, Log Horizon makes plans to celebrate their victory and with the dawn over the horizon, Shiroe and Akatsuki praise each other. In the epilogue, Log Horizon holds a victory party and Regan skips out on his task with repairing the radio equipment to join the festivities.",
