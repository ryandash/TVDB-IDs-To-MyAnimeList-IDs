  "SummaryEnglish": "How far would you go for true love? All his friends said he was just being \"stupid\" and \"delusional,\" but Haruto just couldn't give up on her... Yuzuki, the girl that showed up on his doorstep one day, stole his heart the next, and then left just as abruptly as she arrived. With the faint hope of rekindling the romance they'd shared, Haruto decides to pursue her, moving away from the rural outskirts of Hiroshima to the big city of Tokyo.",
