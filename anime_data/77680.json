  "SummaryEnglish": "Vash the Stampede is a gunman on the run with a 60 billion double dollar bounty on his head which has made it difficult for him to go anywhere without being chased and shot at. Every town he ever visits ends up being destroyed because of his pursuers, but miraculously no one ever gets killed. Meryl and Milly are two insurance agents that have been sent to find Vash the Stampede and keep him under surveillance so no more damage is caused. Meryl, who leads the pair, refuses to believe that the man they have met can possibly be the legendary gunman. This spikey-haired, gangly, young man is extremely friendly, a pacifist, hates blood and suicide, absolutely loves donuts, and is a dork and a crybaby (far from a notorious outlaw). But there is more to Vash and his past than meets the eye.",

      "SummaryEnglish": "Centralną postacią i głównym bohaterem jest Vash the Stampede, legendarny bandyta, za którego głowę wyznaczono nagrodę w wysokości 60 miliardów podwójnych dolarów. Ze względu na ogromne zniszczenia spowodowane przez niego nazywany jest również ludzkim tornadem i porównywany do klęsk żywiołowych. Kwoty odszkodowań wypłacanych przez towarzystwo ubezpieczeniowe na poczet szkód spowodowanych przez Vasha są tak wielkie, że towarzystwo zdecydowało się wysłać agentki Meryl Stryfe i Milly Thompson z zdaniem odnalezienia Vasha i ograniczenia zniszczeń przez niego powodowanych. Problem w tym, że o Vashu krąży ogromna ilość plotek i choć każdy słyszał o nim, to niewielu widziało go na własne oczy. Tak więc gdy agentki spotykają na swej drodze kogoś, kto pasuje do opisu, ale jednocześnie jest fajtłapą, niesamowitym szczęściarzem, kobieciarzem i pacyfistą, nie mogą uwierzyć, że jest on legendarnym bandytą.",

In the end, the girls can't believe that the real Vash is who he actually is, because he's too nice and silly to match up with the rumors about \"Vash the Stampede.\"",
