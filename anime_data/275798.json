Maiya informs Iri and Saber that Tokiomi wishes to discuss an alliance, and Iri agrees to go to the church to discuss the offer. Before his meeting, Tokiomi visits his wife and Rin, giving his daughter a spell book and some wisdom before leaving. During the meeting between Iri and Tokiomi, Tokiomi suggests a temporary alliance to defeat the other contestants first. Iri agrees, but on the condition that Kirei leaves the city and can no longer be involved in the Grail War. Tokiomi complies. As Saber, Iri and Maiya leave the church, a sickly Iri reveals to Maiya that she is actually the embodiment of the Holy Grail in human form and will die to form the Grail once the war ends. Maiya promises to protect her until that time comes. Meanwhile, Kirei is preparing to leave, but reveals to Archer that his father's dying act was to leave Kirei the remaining Command Seals, restoring Kirei's ability to be a master in the War. He also reveals the secret reason behind the war; the Holy Grail can be activated only by the sacrifice of seven Heroic Spirits. Thus, even a victorious Servant must die - which is why Tokiomi is reluctant to use his command spells, as he needs at least one to command Archer's suicide should they be triumphant. Furthermore, Kirei still wants to explore his dark desires, and Archer yearns for a more stimulating master. Later, Kirei meets with Tokiomi, who gives him guardianship of Rin should anything happen to him, and an Azoth dagger as a symbol of his completed apprenticeship. Kirei then stabs Tokiomi in the back with the dagger, telling him that, just like his own father, both men never really understood him. With Tokiomi dead, Archer and Kirei form a new contract as Master and Servant."

Shirley reveals she went into Noritaka's lab and use his immortality formula on herself which turned her into a Dead Apostle vampire who madly craves for blood. Shirley begs Kiritsugu to kill her while she can still have a hold on herself but he is unable to do it which leads her to attacking the townsfolk and turning them into Ghouls. As chaos spread throughout the island, Church Executors and Mages from the Mages Association arrive to stop and exterminate the outbreak and cover up the incident. Kiritsugu is saved from Ghouls when a gun-wielding mercenary named Natalia Kaminski saves him. Natalia explains she is there to eliminate the magus responsible for the outbreak which Kiritsugu realizes is his father. Kiritsugu confronts his father over his work and it's consequences which the latter only shrugs it off as an accident and states his plans to continue his experiments elsewhere. Angered with his father's response, Kiritsugu kills him. Emotionally broken and having nowhere to go, Kiritsugu agrees to escape together with Natalia."
