Akane, Aya, and Arupin, the members of the idol group Tracy, stage a performance at a supermarket, but no one stops to listen to their singing. As the girls redress into maid costumes inside bathroom stalls, Arupin remains optimistic of the reception, pretending the trio is living perfect lives as idols instead of being employees at the supermarket. However, she is scolded by Akane, who chastises her for not facing the reality of their situation. After comparing the dismal number of their fans to the fanbase of a rival idol, Ginger, they receive a call from a woman they call their \"Onee-san\", who praises a performance video they sent her. The girls then eat some manjū, which inspires Akane to speak to the trio's manager, Taguchi. Arupin follows her, but loses her and then finds Taguchi lying dead in a pool of blood. At the crime scene is a bloody knife identical to the ones the girls kept as part of their costumes, along with a partial message written by Taguchi with his blood, beginning with the letter 'A'. Shortly after, Akane and Aya stumble upon the scene as well, then all three are spotted by a man, who assumes they murdered Taguchi and alerts security. The girls then receive a call from Onee-san on Taguchi's cellphone; she instructs them to flee. Taguchi's murder is assigned to Inspector Miho Koigakubo, who declares the girls wanted criminals. Near Musashino Dome, Akane reveals her dream to sing in Musashino Dome in front of a crowd of fans. They then receive another call from Onee-san, who informs them that they were identified as murder suspects and their fanbase skyrocketed as a result. Seconds later, they are spotted by a fan and retreat to a basement parking lot, where they find a motorbike supplied by Onee-san that they use to flee.

Two and a half years later, Aoi is working as a production assistant at Musashino Animation, an animation studio that is currently working on an upcoming anime for the fall season, called Exodus!. She visits Misato Segawa, the animation supervisor for the anime's fourth episode, to retrieve the checked animation. Then, she drives to the studio, where she attends a meeting as the entire crew (including Ema, who is a key animator) watches the premiere of Exodus!. When the anime premieres, it is met with a lukewarm public response, to everyone's relief. Later on, while previewing the third episode, the crew finds that Tarō Takanashi, another production assistant, was unable to finish the key frames in time, thus leaving the quality of the episode's animation erratic. Since there are no other key animators available to finish the frames, the crew turns to Segawa, who reluctantly decides to take the extra job at the request of the third episode's animation supervisor Ryōsuke Endō, who is her rival. Once the frames are finished, Aoi retrieves them before taking the animation director, Hironori Madoka, to a dubbing session. She then stops by Segawa's house and finds her lying on the floor unconscious."

Meanwhile, Aoi receives a call from her mother, who congratulates her on her work on Exodus! despite her confusion about the story, and informs her that her father was also impressed. The scene then flashes back to the time Aoi, Ema, Shizuka, Misa, and Midori presented their club's anime back in high school; although the students were unimpressed by it, the five of them still found pride in their work. The next day, Aoi, Ema, and Shizuka meet up with Misa, now a 3D computer graphics operator, and Midori, a college student who is aspiring to be a scriptwriter. Together, they watch a movie, visit the park, go shopping, and get some drinks. While at Shizuka's workplace, Aoi, Ema, and Misa tell each other about the hardships they are experiencing at work, while Shizuka laments that she has not done anything significant in her work and that she did not do too well on her audition. Later on, Aoi receives a call from Tarō, who asks for her help, but when he goes off-topic, she hangs up on him. When the get-together ends and Aoi and Ema ride the train home, the former remarks that she does not have a concrete anime-related goal in mind. While walking home, Aoi receives a call from Tarō, who again tries asking for help, but she hangs up on him.

With the storyboards for the final episode way behind schedule, being a month late, chief production assistant Yutaka Honda, desperate for progress, goes to extreme lengths and locks Seiichi inside a cage in the storage room in order to get him to finish them, despite his protests. Tarō explains to Aoi that he got caught up as the middle man between Ryōsuke, who wanted to do the key frames for an explosion scene, and the 3D director Yūichirō Shimoyanagi, who had already prepared a CGI explosion, the result of which led Ryōsuke to believe people were favoring 3D over 2D and drop out of directing the eighth episode. An unsatisfied Aoi accuses Tarō of not handling the situation better and tries to tell Honda about it, but he talks her out of it. Caving under the pressure of his new work environment, Seiichi recounts how his once successful career as an anime director took a downfall after the release of Jiggly Jiggly Heaven, and it is revealed Exodus! is his first official anime in six years. Whilst having a drink with his coworker Hotta Hikari, Ryōsuke learns from animator Saburou Kitano about how he is teaching 3D animators himself, stating that it is not about whether 3D is better or not, but rather how it can be used to improve the quality of anime. Aoi and Ema meet up and eat at the latter's house, where they talk about how 3D is continuing to influence the production of anime, which is what led Misa to choosing her career path. The next day, while showing Ryōsuke the 3D-rendered scene of the explosion, Aoi learns that the beginning of episode nine, which follows on from the explosion in the eighth episode, had been finished using key animation."

When the two ask Rinko to be the series' character designer, she declines the offer as she wants to improve her basic animating skills following her experiences animating the cuts of Exodus!‍ '​s final episode. She then recommends Yumi to take her place, and after some reluctance, Yumi agrees to take the job. Next, Aoi and Seiichi talk with art director Yūji Atsumi, who goes into a serious conversation about what kind of clouds should go into the backgrounds in order to fit the scenes. Later, while trying to research on fighter jets for inspiration, Aoi meets up with Midori, who offers to do the research for her and write up an overview of the information.

Later, as Aoi, Seiichi, and Shimeji do some research, they ask Aoi to have Midori commit to her research on fighter jets while discussing how to go about the ending."
