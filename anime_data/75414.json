Answering this challenge on the planet's behalf is Paul Japan, a team of top soccer players handpicked by Paul to defend the pride of soccer as a human sport. Tamama makes friends with a boy he sees practicing his soccer moves everyday. He joins the boy in his daily routine, and even teaches him his trademark Jealousy Ball, adapted for soccer into the Jealousy Shoot - which destroys the boy's old soccer ball by accident. Fortunately the vast resources of the Nishizawa Peach Group fix the ball exactly as it was. Eventually, the boy learns to shed his defensive mindset and play better than he ever could, and Tamama has someone he can truly call a friend.",

Unfortunately Aki goes crazy with the robot's weapons, forcing Kururu to move out in the Kururu Robo to bring her in, resulting in all the unexplained phenomena from the first act.",
