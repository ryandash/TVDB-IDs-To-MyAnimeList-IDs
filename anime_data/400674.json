  "SummaryEnglish": "After the fall of Museum-the evil organization responsible for many crimes in Futo, the production and distribution of Gaia Memories has halted. However, remnants of Gaia Memories still remain within society and are sold on the black market at high prices. Thus, the two heroes from Narumi Detective Office are yet to have time to relax. Sights of Dopants still occur and the agency receives more and more clients who claim to experience supernatural phenomena. Regardless of the arduous nature of the task, Kamen Rider Double promises that those who hurt Futo will inevitably count up their sins.",
