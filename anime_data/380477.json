  "SummaryEnglish": "When 39-year-old Takebayashi Ryoma dies from blood loss (after sneezing and hitting his head on the ground), he is reincarnated as an 8-year-old boy in a fantasy world. Not the greatest way to bite the dust, but at least he reincarnates! Set on this path by three major gods, Ryoma begins to live a life of solitude in the forest, studying slimes. But if you’re a fan of isekai…you know life for him won’t be that simple.",
