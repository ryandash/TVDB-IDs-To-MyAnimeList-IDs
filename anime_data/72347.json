Basara and his band \"Fire Bomber\" are a struggling up and coming group on the Macross 7, an intergalactic colony ship traveling through space looking for a new planet to call home. During its flight, an unknown alien race appeared and started laying siege upon the colony.

Basara, yearning to have his music heard, flies into the battle zone in his Valkyrie to spread the message of music.",
