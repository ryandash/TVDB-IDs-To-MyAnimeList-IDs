Sensing a nostalgic presence only to be greeted by Naruto who is accompanied by Killer B. Their reunion conversation, however, is cut short when Kabuto — thrilled by the prospect of capturing the Eight and Nine-Tails — commanded Itachi to attack. Slicing through the enormous fireball launched at them using Samehada, B later has to apologise to the sentient blade who did not appreciate being used to absorb hot flames. Moving-in, Itachi clashes with Naruto while they converse about Sasuke. Revealing to Itachi that he knew the truth behind the Uchiha Clan Massacre, a shocked Itachi questions how far this news had spread and upon hearing that only a few people knew, requested that it stay that way. Though puzzled, Nagato was forced to attack and the battle between the four shinobi ensue. Retreating atop Nagato's Giant Drill-Beaked Bird, Itachi activates his Mangekyō Sharingan causing one of his crows to emerged from a shocked Naruto's mouth. Casting Amaterasu, Itachi incinerates Nagato's summons as well as Nagato himself, telling the Rinnegan-wielder that his plan had worked. It is revealed that the crow had Shisui Uchiha's Mangekyō Sharingan implanted in its eye socket and the eye was rigged to react to Itachi's eyes and cast Kotoamatsukami: which had the order \"protect Konoha\". Now freed from Kabuto's control, Itachi explains that this was the power he had given to Naruto and had intended for it to be used on his brother. During this explanation, however, Nagato's corpse was able to regenerate and Kabuto, excited by the prospect of acquiring Shisui's DNA, had Nagato attack once again. Hidden in his Giant Snake-Tailed Chameleon, Nagato surprises the group launching a large-scaled Shinra Tensei before targeting B who throttles him in Version 2 only to have Nagato absorb his chakra, restoring him to his youthful-looking self.

In the clutches of Nagato's mechanical arms with a cannon pointing at him in point-blank range, the two jinchūriki are saved by Itachi and his Susanoo. Nagato, however, quickly regenerates and uses Chibaku Tensei with the intent of crushing his targets into the planetary body. Though Naruto raised the alarm that there was little they could do against this technique, Itachi rallies the group and has them use their most powerful long ranged attacks to target the center of the sphere, effectively neutralizing the attack. In the aftermath of this, Itachi is able to pierce Nagato with his Totsuka Sword freeing the Rinnegan-wielder from Kabuto's control. With the time he had left, Nagato lamented the fact that he had sullied the brilliant legacy their master had left behind and told Naruto to be the most amazing end to the trilogy that he could be. With this, Naruto tries to move out to the battlefield, but his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode wears off leading Itachi to tell him to not rely solely on his own power, but to put some trust in his comrades and their own power. After telling B to take care of Naruto, he incinerates the crow with Shisui's Sharingan and departs to deal with the person controlling the reincarnated shinobi.",

Remembering the past, Yota was being held by the ANBU for questioning, the ANBU sensing something wrong with Yota. Naruto acts a decoy for Shikamaru, Kiba, Akamaru, Ino, Chōji and Sakura to sneak in. Shikamaru manages to temporarily paralyse the ANBU, but they soon get the upper hand. About to attack Naruto, Yota acts out and strikes the ANBU with his lightning.

They try to talk to Yota, but he erases their memories of him and their time together. During the war, Yota reveals he was already dead when they first met, having been one of the earliest subjects of the Impure World Reincarnation when Orochimaru began testing it. Yota tells them about how his clan travelled selling weather, which they could control, and how despite being particularly good at it, Yota's body was frail, leading to an early death. Yota covers himself in snow, causes lightning to strike him, leaving Naruto and the others shocked.",

Bringing forth Orochimaru afterwards, Kabuto has him transformed into the white snake form to assault the two brothers. However, through their combined effort, Itachi and Sasuke are able to escape the genjutsu. Kabuto surprises Itachi and bisects him all the while shedding tears and told Itachi that a genius like him would not understand him, declaring that no one shall stand in his way. As his body reforms, Itachi called out to Sasuke as he threw his sword at Kabuto, only to be caught by his navel-snake. Sasuke launches a fireball at Kabuto, however, the latter easily counters with a water technique. Kabuto then attacks Itachi with the sword and claimed that his genjutsu cannot affect him. The sequence of events repeats itself as Kabuto notices the déjá vu. It is later revealed to be happening all in Kabuto's head as he is trapped within the endless loop of Izanami.",

Angered by the fact that Itachi would cast a technique that has an escape route, Sasuke questions his motives to which Itachi says that he wished to give Kabuto an opportunity to accept his fate. Sasuke, however, claims that Itachi is perfect and rather different from Kabuto but the elder Uchiha refuses this claim.

When asked where he got his Sharingan from, Tobi upsets Kakashi by claiming to obtained it while from battle at the Kannabi Bridge. As Tobi states there is no more hope for the world, Naruto rejects his views and Kurama — who briefly takes over his Jinchuriki's body — declares that Minato sealed him within Naruto to give the youth the power to take him down.

Madara, however, blocks the attack and defeats the clone. Then, he manages to capture the Eight and the Nine-Tails. Kakashi uses this opportunity to question his old friend about what happened to him and Obito remember about when he attacked Konoha and confronted by his former sensei, also making him have a flashback of his first encounter with his team and then states that he no longer cared about this world. Meanwhile, Naruto declares to Madara that he was Fourth Hokage's son and would not be overpowered by him. Madara then creates an enormous wood dragon, which he notes had been used by Hashirama Senju in the past to bind the Nine-Tails. This forces Naruto to use Tailed Beast Mode to fight it. Kakashi continues to ask Obito why he chose to follow someone like Madara, but the Uchiha notes that he had nothing left to say to him and that this is their final fight. Continuing their battle, Obito leaves an attack with many shuriken, but is stopped by Kakashi's wall of earth. As Obito slips through the wall, Kakashi continues to ask him if the reason was related to Rin, to which Obito sharply retorts telling \"this scum\" to shut up. Obito then warps Kakashi to the other dimension, but Kakashi soon returns with the same technique. In the meantime, the Wood Dragon begins absorbing Kurama's chakra, causing Naruto on the verge of breakdown. The legendary Uchiha also uses Wood Release to bind Killer B and Might Guy, then begins to activate his Susanoo to finish things up on the battlefield. Disregarding this, Naruto notes that the Uchiha's ideals annoyed him and, by creating a shadow clone, he is able to stop both Obito's shuriken and Madara's Susanoo Sword from killing Kakashi, Guy and Gyūki respectively. Hearing Naruto's words that he would protect his friends, Kakashi and Guy both spring into action with the former using Lightning Cutter to dest",

Madara and Obito take command of the Ten-Tails, and discuss whether they should move their plans along or test its power. Kurama develops a strategy against the Ten-Tails, resulting in a gamble with a Kakashi releasing B from Kamui's dimension right in front of the beast to target its eye, but it simply flicks the Tailed Beast Ball right back at B. Running low on chakra, B and Naruto revert from their Tailed Beast Modes. Naruto moves in to create more shadow clones, but ends up discussing ideals with Obito. Obito has the Ten-Tails fire a Tailed Beast Ball at them, which misses due to the timely arrival and intervention of Ino, Hinata, and a few others. Several Aburame and Kirigakure shinobi disrupt sensing and conceal the battlefield. The rest of the Allied Shinobi Forces arrives at the battlefield, revealed as the Ten-Tails swipes its tail to blow away their cover. Naruto boldly claims that the Allied Shinobi Forces Technique is more powerful than the Infinite Tsukuyomi. Remaining unimpressed by their swollen numbers, Obito argues with Naruto some more, during which time Shikaku relays the Alliance a strategy through Inoichi's telepathy. The Alliance sequentially blinds the Ten-Tails, sinks it into the ground, and binds it with a quick-drying mixture of water and quicklime. Madara notes the good coordination from shinobi from different countries. Shikaku instructs the Alliance to cooperate with Naruto in exploiting the limits of Obito's intangibility, and taijutsu-capable shinobi to attack Madara. As their assault begins, Obito and Madara note that they cling to hope that doesn't exist as the Ten-Tails begins changing.",

Realizing the inevitable, Shikaku has Inoichi relay one final plan to the Alliance in order to stop Madara and Obito, before the HQ is annihilated. Afterwards, Madara outlines his plan to become the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki to Obito, before the latter has the Ten-Tails launch a barrage of wooden spikes at the Alliance, killing countless more shinobi, and also resulting in Neji receiving a fatal wound after defending Naruto. As Neji dies in Naruto's arms, Obito uses the opportunity to demoralize Naruto. However, Hinata with support from Kurama steps in and boosts Naruto's morale. Afterwards, Obito recklessly launches a close-ranged Tailed-Beast Ball, which is repelled by the recovered Bee.
