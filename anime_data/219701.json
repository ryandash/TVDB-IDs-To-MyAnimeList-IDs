When her Limiter, Leo, arrives, Ingrid gives Satellizer one more chance to get a Limiter, for which Kazuya volunteers despite being warned of the consequences of associating with Satellizer. Thanks to his powerful Freezing ability, Satellizer is able to knock down both Leo and Ingrid, but, hellbent on punishing Satellizer, Ingrid refuses to give up and goes into Pandora Mode, leaving Kazuya confused as to why Ingrid takes hierarchy discipline so seriously. Ganessa reveals to Kazuya that a year ago during an outdoor training session, Ingrid's best friend Marina died when she fought a Nova alone, and she believes Marina would have survived had the younger students not run away due to a lack of discipline in their ranks. Hearing this, Kazuya freezes Ingrid and tells her that he understands her pain just like he had when he lost his sister. He tells her her actions are tainting her late friend's memories, that Marina didn't die in vain as she was actually sacrificing her life to protect the younger students. With Ganessa confirming it as well, Ingrid realizes this isn't what Marina wanted, and breaks down in tears at the truth.",

As she tries to remain conscious while the third-years argue on what to do with her, Satellizer recalls when she and her mother were brought into the El Bridget household.
