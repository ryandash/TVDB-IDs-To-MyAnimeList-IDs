These are secrets that only Cheng Xiaoshi and Lu Guang are able to find. In a small shop called \"Time Photo Studio,\" the two friends provide a special service: using their extraordinary powers that let them enter photographs, they jump into pictures brought to them by clients in order to grant their wishes.
