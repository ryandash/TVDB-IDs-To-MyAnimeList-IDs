However, Gorgo could not do this alone, as he had to take over the mind of man's best friend and turn them into humanity's worst nightmare. As the pack of dogs ran through the streets of Tokyo, the massive reptile joined the brutal assault! Bursting out of the ground, Gorgo stomped through the streets of Tokyo, roaring his fury and using his massive head as a battering ram to destroy buildings around him. Soon, his dogs found a school and Gorgo followed, stomping on the building with his massive feet. The D-Force soon arrived and started to fire missiles at the saurian to no avail. After trying to bring down the ship with his flame breath, the Tachibana twins combined, turning their ship into Super Aizenborg. The warship flew directly through the dinosaur, causing the super saurian to explode from the inside out and ending the life of Ururu’s first minion"

As two cave spelunkers wandered into the cavern, Terano used his hypnotic eyes to take over the minds of a colony of bats living in the darkness. In no time, the bats reduced the humans to skeletons and the gigantic, winged reptile took to the sky with a swarm of red bats following closely behind!"

But a strange sound filled the air, causing the rat to grow red in color and screech at the two men! What followed was a wave of rats, hungry for flesh!"

Burrowing through the ground at high speeds, the horned dinosaur burst through the streets of Tokyo, roaring his arrival, only to be answered by the D-Force firing missiles at the armored monster. Shrugging off the assault, Chirako charged at the ground vehicle Aizen 1, which moved quickly out of the way, causing the enraged dinosaur to run head first into a building. When Ai and Zen went to combine into Super Aizenborg, they found a massive crater where the saurian once stood. It wasn't long before Chirako reappeared, bursting out of the ground near Tokyo Tower! With a well aimed blast, the dinosaur fired his heat beam at the tower's foundation, causing it to tip! The Super Aizenborg flew in, using itself to prop the building up for the civilians to escape, as Chirako once again disappeared underground."

Days later, the woman was contacted by the D-Force, who used her flute playing to their advantage, luring the monster out of hiding!

The tarbosaurus fell to her side, screaming in pain, clutching at her stomach. As the minutes passed, the poor reptile thrashed about in utter pain until relief came, in the form of a giant egg emerging from the water nearby! The D-Force was alerted that a new mother dinosaur was present near a power plant, and they were deployed. As a mother, Torara had to protect her unhatched children from the attackers! With a stream of flames from her mouth, she showed a mother's true fury, but when Ai and Zen combined, forming the Super Aizenborg, even the mother's protective instinct couldn't overcome humanity’s guardian. The battleship drilled through her belly, instantly killing the reptilian parent before she ever got the chance to see her offspring."

In order to learn more about the aquatic reptiles, Ururu dispatched Parasa to guard the saurians. The massive hadrosaur was soon put to the test when the D-Force raced to the island and were instantly bombarded with heat beam after heat beam from the duckbilled dinosaur. However, the saurian retreated back into a cave after a barrage of missiles scored a direct hit. After a while, Parasa was lured out of the cave and into the ocean, where the twins combined, transforming the Aizenborg 1 into the Super Aizenborg! With Parasa in the water, the battleship dove under the waves, and after a brief moment of silence, two halves of the dinosaur slowly floated up to the surface, signifying the end of Parasa."
