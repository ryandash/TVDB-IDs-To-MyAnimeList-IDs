    "SummaryEnglish": "Born and raised in the countryside of Japan, Hinako \"Hina\" Sakuragi gets anxious easily when she talks to new people—so much so that she resembles a stiff scarecrow. To overcome this, Hina hopes to get involved in theater, inspired by a play she saw during her school's field trip. So, Hina moves into the Hitotose Manor in the bustling city of Tokyo to study at Fujiyama High School, aspiring to join the school's renowned theatre club. But to Hina's dismay, she learns that Fujiyama High's theatre club has been on a lengthy hiatus. Having already come to Tokyo and enrolled in the school, Hina is at a loss for what to do next. Sensing her disappointment and eagerness to learn theatre, Chiaki Hagino, the landlady of Hitotose Manor, encourages Hina to create a troupe with the residents of Hitotose Manor as its members. This story follows Hina as she begins a new life in Tokyo attending Fujiyama High while learning the ropes of theatre with the support of her friends along the way.",

After hearing her reason, Chiaki tells her there's no plan yet for the Fujimiya High theater club to return, so maybe it would be best to start a new troupe.

Since the child is next to Chiaki, Hinako and Kuina wonder if she's a theater troupe relation, or perhaps even Chiaki's daughter. Finally, Yua can't stand to listen anymore and straightens them out.",
