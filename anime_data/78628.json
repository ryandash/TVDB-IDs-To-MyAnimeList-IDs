Much smaller than either the regular Transformers, the Mini-Cons can connect to their large counterparts granting them new abilities. Each Mini-Con enhances the power of a Transformer exponentially. Our only chance for a peaceful cosmos is for Optimus Prime and the Autobots to defeat their enemies and free all Mini-Cons.",

The episode opens in space, with our narrator explaining the history of the race called \"\"Transformers\"\" in brief. After a short intro, the masculine narrator says that the race settled, a planet that was eventually called Cybertron. A war broke out between the Autobots and Decepticons, over a race of what are called \"\"Smart Tools\"\", Mini-Cons. The war escalated to a stalemate, and both the Autobots and Decepticons both finally agreed that the war was too costly, and sent all the Mini-Cons away in a large Green Vessel, very reminscent of the Ark from Generation 1. This \"\"Ark\"\" travelled through space for a great deal of time, and landed on a primatvie planet after a damaging collision with its moon. The Mini-Cons laid dormant in this \"\"ship\"\" for over a million years, until today, where our story begins.

The children manage to escape, and Megatron is distracted long enough for Optimus to lay a blow on Megatron that knocks him the ground. The Decepticons retreat from battle, to a crashed ship portion on the moon. Another Decepticon, who is introduced as Cyclonus, is assigned to finding the ancient Mini-Con starship that crashed on the moon.
