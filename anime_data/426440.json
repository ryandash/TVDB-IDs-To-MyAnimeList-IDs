One fine day, a man named Sagawa Jingi, who claims to be one of his late father's three disciples, comes to meet Yukito and offers to take him back to his native island: Ayagashima. The latter is at the heart of a famous legend, according to which dragons of fire and water as well as mysterious creatures inhabit it.

If the trio has always known how to put their differences aside in order to protect the harmony of the island, certain deep quarrels begin to take over and gradually break the balance of life on the archipelago. Soon, Yukito will be confronted with the truth…",
