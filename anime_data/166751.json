His name is Gen Tokishima and he is the only one who can retrieve one part of the starmap hidden within the Earth. After retrieving the piece, Gen must make a decision to either follow Lipumira in her foolhardy search to find the remaining pieces of the starmap or rather stay on Earth.

Unfortunately, as Gen learns the secret of the starmap, Lipumira's sisters appear, planning to stop her at any cost.",
