  "TitleEnglish": "Armed Girl's Machiavellism",
  "SummaryEnglish": "The Private Aichi Symbiosis Academy was originally a high school for high-class girls. When it became co-ed, the girls, out of fear, asked to be permitted to bring weapons to school. When that was enforced, a five-member vigilante corps-like organization called the \"Supreme Five Swords\" was also formed. After many generations, the five swords eventually became a group which corrected problematic students, and the academy started proactively accepting such students in order to correct them. Nomura Fudou was sent to this school after being part of a huge brawl. What will he do when the only options he has after enrolling are being expelled from that school or being corrected the way the rest of the male students there were...by being forced to dress and act like a girl!",

          "SummaryEnglish": "Nomura has conquered Kirukiru Amou, but the Five Swords, which should have kept the school in order, must now answer for their failure and learn from their mistakes. The head teacher of the Aichi Academy also quickly found the main problem of the five girls: each of them is so proud that they simply cannot work together! And to solve this problem, she now wants to send the five to an onsen department as part of a teambuilding exercise. Since they are allowed to choose exactly one other student to accompany them on the trip, Nomura is of course part of the party, but before he can splash around with the girls in a hot spring, he has to face an academic challenge after all the fighting and study hard ... Note: This is Episode 13.",
