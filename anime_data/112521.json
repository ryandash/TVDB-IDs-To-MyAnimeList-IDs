  "SummaryEnglish": "In a land of perpetual night, your heart is your light. Amberground is locked in darkness. A man-made star casts only a dim light over the land. The pitch-black wilderness is infested with Gaichuu--colossal insects with metal exoskeletons. The Gaichuu make travel between the cities of Amberground extremely dangerous. But thankfully the Letter Bees, a brave corps of messengers, risk their lives in order to keep the hearts of Amberground connected. Gauche Suede is on his last delivery before a big promotion. In the outskirts of Yodaka, the darkest area of Amberground, Gauche is surprised to find that the package is a young boy named Lag Seeing. Lag had been traumatized by his mother's abduction and is due to be delivered to his aunt. In this remote area rife with Gaichuu, Lag and Gauche face a dangerous journey that inspires Lag to become a Letter Bee.",

Ray wants Lag to find out who sent her picture letters of hydrangea-colored mountains, and explains the pictures remind her of her childhood while living in a village. Ray's parents received governmental positions in Central and had her moved to a location close by to receive care as she is sickly. However, she is cheered up by the letters, which she feels they tell her to keep on fighting her illness. Lag searches through town for information on the origin of the letters and finds out that the hydrangea colors came from Blue Romeo flower dyes. While searching for Niche at the mansion's garden, Lag finds Kimidori picking Blue Romeo flowers and concludes she is the sender, which she readily admits. Kimidori is glad that Ray is encouraged by her letters, but refuses to tell Lag further and makes him promise not to reveal this. However, when Lag wonders how to tell Ray, he discovers Colbasso has claimed credit for the letters for her own selfish reasons. Although Lag promised not to tell, he shoots a shindan into the letter, which reveals a flashback of Ray's childhood. It turns out Ray met and befriended Kimidori when she was young. Before she moved, Ray gives her a matching hairpin as proof of their friendship. When Kimidori grew older, her family owed debts and she is forced to sell the hairpin. Feeling guilty for having sold the hairpin, Kimidori leaves home to search for Ray's current residence and eventually finds it. She then plants the Blue Romeo in the garden to remind Ray of her childhood. Ray reunites with Kimidori and thanks her for the happy memories.

Moc Sullivan comes in with news of being ambushed and losing his letters in a ravine. When Lag offers to help retrieve the letters, Hazle and Carib stop the Bees as they have no qualification to deal with Reverse, and they also suspect a leak within the Bee Hive. However, Lag, Niche and Steak stow themselves away on the inspectors' carriage. Upon discovering Lag has followed them, the inspectors decide to let him and the others follow them to the ravine. Finding the letters scattered around, Lag offers to help collect the letters when Carib tells him he will reveal what he knows about Gauche. After Lag and Niche are distracted by Carib and Hazle respectively, Carib uses a catalysing agent that resonates with the hearts in the letters to attract a gaichuu. After Lag and Niche destroy the gaichuu, Lag inadvertently finds a letter regarding the leader of Reverse, Lawrence. He reveals he is a failed man-made spirit created by an experiment sanctioned by the government and stirs up support from the populace. Gauche/Noir is confirmed to be working for Reverse. Although disappointed, Lag remains firm in delivering letters for the people. Later, Lawrence listens to the results of the experiment to attract gaichuu from the inspectors, who are revealed to be working for Reverse. Lawrence decides the time has come for Reverse to make their next move and sends Noir and Roda to the north.",

When Lag asks about Noir, they confirm that Noir went to the cave, which is a path leading to Blue Notes Scale and the holy site. The mayor warns Lag not to enter as he will be punished severely.

She corrects Lag on the townspeople's story: Celica was actually forced to enter the cave to become a sacrifice for the Maka when the lack of warmth persisted, which was caused by the mining of spirit amber in the region. Celica begged the Maka to at least let her unborn child live. For the first time, the Maka sheds a tear for a human, and the tear blesses Celica. After Celica gave birth to the twins and died, the town declared them to be cursed and kept them isolated with only water as sustenance.

The sister sinks to the bottom of the lake and grows sad, eventually transforming into her adult form. Instead of searching for Niche, she decided to stay in the cave where the Maka resided as she believed that Niche would sense her heritage and make her way back like she did. Lag throws the sister back to her senses by saying she was foolish like a human as well. Her heart softened, the sister takes Niche to Tir na Lake to heal her wounds. She also explains to Lag that the gaichuu frozen in the cave are metamorphosing when they shed their last piece of heart and the Maka froze them to prevent them from causing chaos to the world.

After Lag and Connor make it out of the debris safely, Lag goes after Roda. Sunny finds Connor and gives him the cookies to eat, which causes him to collapse. Sunny and the abbey's sad past is revealed: despite trying to work hard, the abbey never rose above poverty and hardship, which made them easy prey for Reverse to convince them of its ideals.
