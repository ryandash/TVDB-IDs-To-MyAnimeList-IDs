Ihm zur Seite stehen Shinpachi Shimura, ein Junge mit Brille und einem starken Herzen, Kagura mit ihrem Regenschirm und ihrem scheinbar bodenlosen Magen sowie Sadaharu, ihr übergroßer Hund. Natürlich sind diese Gelegenheitsjobs nicht immer einfach, da sie häufig mit der Polizei, zusammengewürfelten Rebellen und Attentätern zusammenstoßen, was oft zu lustigen, aber unglücklichen Konsequenzen führt.",
