When homeroom ends, the class begs Yukiji to stay as a teacher causing Shiori to burst out in tears, who is happy that the class cares for her and decides to not resign. The resignation letter belonged to Shiori who found being Yukiji's superior harder than she thought. Yukiji was happy because she found many signs of good fortune."
