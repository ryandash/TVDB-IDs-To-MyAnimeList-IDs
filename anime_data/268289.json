                    "SummaryEnglish": "After having crash landed on a remote part of the moon Haruto mourns Kyūma's death while L-elf tries and gives up on devising a plan. At the same time the Dorssians transport Module 77 to a Dorssian Dyson Sphere. Elsewhere, A-drei interrogates Saki on L-elf's betrayal and realizes that he was acting on their shared goal of revolutionizing the corrupted Dorssia. Meanwhile Haruto and L-elf start blaming each other on everything that had happened which quickly escalates into a physical confrontation. Meanwhile, Shōko decides to pilot the Valvrave 01 and protect the Sakimori students but finds it inoperable until presented with the start up question. The Pino AI then replays the video of Haruto first piloting Unit 01 and she breaks into tears after realizing that everything he did was for her. Back on the moon, Haruto reveals to a disbelieving L-elf that Liselotte was a Magius, with the latter soon connecting the dots. After realizing that they have much yet to accomplish before they die, they put aside their differences and agree to build a unified world where everyone including humans and Magius can live in peace. They then manage to ignite a rescue flare using Haruto's Magius powers which draws a squadron of Dorssian mecha. Much to Haruto and L-elf's surprise however Saki and the Valvrave 04 show up and rescue them. At the same time, X-eins demands answers after A-drei releases Saki."

                    "TitleEnglish": "Revolution to the Future",
                    "SummaryEnglish": "The modified Valvrave 02 piloted by Cain destroys the Module 77 communications terminal and proceeds to clash with the Valvrave 01. As Unit 01 becomes overwhelmed by Unit 02's power, X-eins' Kirchbaum intercepts the duel to avenge H-neun. As the Magius also pass off the conference's events as an act to the world, A-drei's Kirchbaum finds himself blocked by a battle crazed Q-vier. When Unit 01 finds itself blasted straight into Module 77, X-eins mounts a failed suicide attack against Unit 02. In the midst of Haruto's Rune deprivation, L-elf shows up and they combine their skills against Cain by way of a possession. At the same time, A-drei kills Q-vier after failing to reason with him. As the Valvrave 01 and 02 head into space once more, Cain blames the Valvrave pilots for disrupting the Magius' attempt at world peace. Amidst the chaos, President Anderson also exposes the Magius to the world, sparking various Dorssian uprisings in favor of the Royalists. As Unit 02 pushes Unit 01 to its limit, Haruto calls upon the fighting spirit of his friends, amplifying Unit 01's power and brutally destroys Unit 02, killing Cain whilst also losing all of his memories in the process. In the aftermath, L-elf awakens in the cockpit and rushes to a weakened amnesiac Haruto. Realizing the steep cost of their victory, L-elf sheds tears for his friend before Haruto passes on. In the epilogue, humanity bands together to hunt down the remaining Magius while peace finally dawns on the new world order. Finally, as Saki and Akira conclude the origin story of the Third Galactic Empire to the Prince, Shōko meets two hostile alien lifeforms in the Memorial Core and offers them friendship—echoing what Haruto would have done."
