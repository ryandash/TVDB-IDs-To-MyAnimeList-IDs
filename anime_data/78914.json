Imprisoned, Tessa laments over the situation, but takes courage from Kaname’s strength and resolve not to let it get her down. Kaname and Tessa are taken to Lt. Kalinin at gunpoint, where they demand information about the Lambda driver or the girls will be shot. With a bit of deception and help from Tessa, the interrogator is subdued and the hostages move to make their escape, but first, they must confirm what lies in the ship’s cargo hold. This suspicion about the Clinton’s cargo is confirmed. A colossal AS with tremendous destructive power is anchored below deck. They have little time to gawk, as Seina, Takuma, and their guards confront the gang. Just as things about to turn bad, Sousuke and Kurz bust in and take the fight to the guards.

Behemoth pursues the truck through the city, spraying 20mm cannon fire in the vehicle’s wake. Desperate to stop Behemoth, Tessa orders the launching of the ARX-7 Arbalest that Commander Mardukas had prepared for just such an occasion.

Breaking out his sniper rifle, Kurz draws a bead on the Behemoth’s head Vulcans and manages to disable half of them. With the Arbalest on the scene, Sousuke bails to take to his AS and combat the giant, but getting at his AS will prove more of a challenge than he’d like. With a little bit of luck, Sousuke manages to board the Arbalest and take the fight to the Behemoth. Despite the Arbalest’s battle capabilities, the Behemoth is going to be a tough nut to crack.",
