  "SummaryEnglish": "Matsurika, a lady-in-waiting in the imperial palace, has a special talent—an excellent memory. One day, she is asked to act as a practice partner for a nobleman's arranged meeting, only to discover that her partner is none other than Emperor Hakuyou himself, who wished to try a matchmaking meeting. Impressed by her skill, the emperor unexpectedly tells her to \"go pass the imperial examination first.\" Thus begins the tale of a girl singled out by the emperor in this Chinese-style Cinderella story.",
