          "SummaryEnglish": "The reason why Nanami's followers, Keiko, Yuuko, and Aiko, are with her even though Nanami is so bad-natured, is that they all have crush on her brother, Touga. One day, Nanami throws a party to cheer up Touga, who hasn't been himself ever since he was beaten by Utena. At the party, Nanami orders Keiko to go to school and do some Student Council paper work for her. Keiko didn't get to attend the party. Keiko realizes that unlike Nanami and Touga, she is in such a low-society that she will never get Touga to look at her. One day, Keiko finds Touga walking in the rain without an umbrella. Keiko gets him under her umbrella. Nanami happens to see it. After this, Nanami tells Keiko that she never knew there was a bad bug so close to her. Nanami says she will exterminate this bad bug, i.e. Keiko. Keiko consults at Nemuro Memorial Hall and she confesses her feelings.",

          "SummaryEnglish": "There is only one black rose left now. Akio is wondering if Mikage will finally fight Utena himself. But instead of fighting, Mikage decides to include Utena in his side, and asks Utena to join his Mikage Seminar, but Utena turns it down. Mikage talks about Nemuro Memorial Hall, where Mikage now holds his seminar. Decades ago, there was a professor called Professor Nemuro, who was doing some research at the hall. One day, there was a fire, and the hall burned down, which took away 100 lives of his students. Professor Nemuro was actually Mikage himself. He used to work with 100 brilliant schoolboys on Project Rose Signet, which was a research to revolutionize the world and obtain eternity. Since it was only a contract with the academy, or Akio himself, Professor Nemuro was indifferent about the objectives. One day, an inspector from the trustee, Chida Tokiko, came to Professor Nemuro's office. Later, Tokiko invited Professor Nemuro to her home. And Mikage met Tokiko's brother Chida Mamiya for the first time. Mamiya had a fatal disease, and for his sake, Tokiko wanted to get eternity that the academy was seeking for. From this day, Professor Nemuro became enthusiastic about the research. Afterwards, Akio appeared in Professor Nemuro's office, and gave him a ring with the Rose Signet and made a contract of the Rose Signet with him: \"I suppose you have no choice but to revolutionize the world. The way before has been prepared,\" Akio said. One night, Mamiya set fire to the hall. Professor Nemuro said to Tokiko that Mamiya was right, and this sacrifice of 100 lives was the necessary first step to reach the stage of the revolution from the academy. Back to the present time, Tokiko, now an old woman, comes to the academy to visit Mamiya's *grave*, and also meet Akio for the first time after the decades. She says Professor Nemuro, as well as Akio, is still as young as he was back then.",

          "SummaryEnglish": "Mikage asks Utena to join his seminar again, actually trying to include her in his side, the Black Rose Association. This time, to convince her, he also offers himself as a consultant so that Utena can ask him when Utena or her friends have any problem. Thinking about Anthy's Rose Bride problem, Utena decides to see Mikage. But at Nemuro Memorial Hall, Utena finds photographs of Duelists, Kozue, Shiori, Wakaba, and others. Utena notices that Mikage is behind this whole thing. Utena challenges Mikage to a duel. During the duel, Mikage tells Utena that Utena is the same as him in the sense that Utena met somebody who completely changed the life, and can't get over it. That's why she is a Duelist first of all. Later in the middle of the duel, Mikage suddenly hears Mamiya's voice, which says Mikage will be beaten. Mikage finds in Mamiya's position of the photographs someone he doesn't know --- He finally recalls this boy was the real Mamiya for the first time after decades. The real Mamiya actually died back then, and it was Mikage who set fire to the hall. And this whole thing about Mikage was all Akio's plot; For a long time, Akio has been manipulating Mikage's mind to take advantage of his brain (Mikage was the one who opened the way to the castle), besides Akio says that Mikage didn't even exist in the first place, just like Mamiya didn't.",
