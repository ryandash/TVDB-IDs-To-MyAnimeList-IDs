He is asleep and not easily woken, so Sanji decides to prepare something himself. While he is cooking, the old man wakes up and immediately recognizes Sanji's way of handling the carving knife, for he knew Sanji's mentor, \"Red-Leg\" Zeff. He insists that Sanji taste some of his cooking. Sanji is amazed by the flavor, but cannot figure out how the old man made it. Intent on discovering the secret, he searches the city for seasonings that might have been used. Perchance he gets to eat an onigiri made by the old man and realizes that he uses a special salt. The salt was created by Aqua Laguna. As the storm floods the lower parts of the city, it covers the buildings with sea water. In the following sunny days, particularly tasty residual salt is left on the rooftops.",

They fear that, should he stay with them, he might be captured once more and that they would not be able to rescue him again.

Seeing that he can no longer fight, Zoro offers his life to save Luffy, saying that he cannot hope to become the world's best swordsman if he cannot protect his captain. Sanji attempts to take Zoro's place, but Zoro knocks him out. As part of his agreement with Kuma, Zoro takes in all of Luffy's pain and fatigue, which Kuma says would kill him if he suffered it on top of his already severe wounds. Zoro takes in the pain, and Kuma leaves, remarking on how Luffy has a loyal crew. Luffy regains consciousness, surprisingly energetic, while Zoro emerges from his sacrifice near death.",

Ten years ago Doflamingo appeared in the king's chambers, asking for a 10 billion Beli ransom, in order to leave the country alone. Riku sent his soldiers to ask of the citizens' money, but while they were willingly trying to help their king, Doflamingo controlled Riku and his soldiers with his ability, and made them attack their own people against their will. In the shadows, Doflamingo and his crew are waiting for the right moment to interfere and act as a saving hero in the eyes of Dressrosa's confused citizens.",

Then, Doflamingo appears with his strongest subordinates and defeats the king and his army, setting the grounds for his takeover of the island. After telling the Straw Hat Pirates of the tragedies of the past, Thunder Soldier explains that the king is still alive since Viola pledged her service to Doflamingo in exchange for the King's life. He, also, explained that although the toys of Dressrosa were once people who despised Doflamingo, they still remember who they were, but not each other and that the drive for revolution is still in them. In the underground chamber, almost all of the fighters were transformed except for Riku and Chinjao, with the latter having mysteriously forgotten that he had grandchildren. In the colosseum, Luffy meets up with Zoro and Kin'emon with the help of Bartolomeo, although he was nowhere to be seen.",
