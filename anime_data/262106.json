After viewing her childhood memories, Tomoe takes young Nanami away from Mizuki. After spending time with young Nanami while strolling around in the town, young Nanami asked Tomoe if he loves her, to which he confirms. Tomoe then proposes a marriage with her, to which she agrees. Just then, Mizuki carries Nanami out of the gate, and Tomoe is upset that Nanami is unable to remember him in her fantasy. Furthermore, Nanami does not know much about her mother, especially since all of the photos of her mother were burned in a house fire long ago. When Nanami, Tomoe and Mizuki make it to the Year God Shrine, they are reluctant to find out that it is blocked by the Lord Year God's sheep, of which its wool takes up a lot of room. Nanami calms the sheep down so that the Lord Year God can trim its wool."
