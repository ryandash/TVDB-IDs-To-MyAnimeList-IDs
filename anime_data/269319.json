    "SummaryEnglish": "Toosaka Rin and Luviagelita Edelfelt are magi from the Clock Tower, the headquarters of the Mage's Association, and they were sent by its director to collect Class Cards, each holding the powers of a Servant from the Holy Grail War. To aid in their quest, they were handed two powerful magic wands, Rin receiving Magical Ruby and Luvia taking Magical Sapphire. However, due to the two girls' inability to get along, the wands got fed up with them and broke their contract. Ruby then sought a new master, and found one in an unsuspecting school girl by the name of Illyasviel von Einzbern. Despite Illya's protests, Ruby insisted in making a magical girl out of her, and she is now Prisma Illya. With no knowledge in magecraft and no previous training of her own, she must now collect the powerful Class Cards using whatever limited aid Rin can give her. Will the two at least to enter a truce with Luvia and Sapphire's new master and work together for this goal?",

Following their plan, Luvia restrains the enemy while Rin provides a mean to enhance Illya and Miyu's attack, providing an opening for Kuro to attack. However, the enemy manages to block it with a shield and counterattacks, forcing the girls to retreat while Bazett charges in, only to get stabbed by multiple swords wielded by the enemy. As Bazett fights using the Berserker's power, Illya and Kuro stay behind to give her a chance to strike, but are still unable to defeat it. Barely managing to escape, Bazett informs the others that the enemy possesses a second Archer card, before it suddenly appears in the real world."

As Caren theorises that the creature is targeting the Holy Grail, with Kuro deducing it relates to a different Holy Grail War entirely, the enemy starts heading towards Mt. Enzou, where it uncovers a magic circle. While trying to push them out of it, Illya pushes out a human boy that was inside it."
