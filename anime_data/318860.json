                    "SummaryEnglish": "Masamune walks in the shopping district, describing himself as the perfect man. He returns home, learning that his cousin Haruka and his aunt Asae look exactly like his mom Kinue. Chinatsu convinces Kinue, Haruka and Asae to wear matching outfits and takes several pictures of them. While Haruka confesses that she wanted to marry Masamune, he claims that somebody already has his heart, though she still offers to be next in line. Aki, Yoshino, Neko, Tae and Kojūrō travel by yacht and visit Aki's summer villa at Tsunade Island. Yuisaki nosily asks Aki if she was dumped by Masamune, and Aki confirms that Masamune only gave himself more attention. This is shown when Masamune smacks into a street lamp while admiring himself in the shopping district. After a day at the beach, the girls gather together to talk about relationships, but they end up studying for the entrance exams. A drunk Yuisaki carries Kojūrō under her arm, while spurring up a conversation about loving attractive guys. As everyone else falls asleep, Aki calls Masamune at night, and she confirms to him that she is lonely. At the mansion, Yoshino is advised by her sister Shigeno Koiwai to have the day off. Shigeno gives Yoshino a haircut and a manicure before sending her outside in formal attire. As spectators turn heads, Yoshino contemplates that she always wore flat shoes and comfortable clothes which allowed her to be at Aki's beck and call. She enjoys a dessert served by a waiter and receives a balloon given by a bear mascot. Yoshino sees a boy and a girl who resemble Masamune and Aki as children, and after the boy accidentally drops his ice cream onto her dress, Yoshino gives up her balloon to the boy as a sign of forgiveness. She changes into causal attire in a dressing room, and she is glad to roam freely without getting attention. Returning to the mansion, Yoshino tells Shigeno that she wants to become prettier on her own, though she jokes about planning to dump the guy who falls in love with her."
