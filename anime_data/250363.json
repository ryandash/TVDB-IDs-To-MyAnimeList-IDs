Chifusa is put on a training course to cleanse and rebuild a pile of rocks that form a nipple-like fountain in order to purify her breasts. However, just before she completes the fountain, she is approached by Kagefusa, who steals the Manyu scroll only to find the Chichinagare technique cannot be learned, as it was passed down from her mother's bloodline. Noticing Kagefusa's sorrow for having small breasts, Chifusa gives her the opportunity to cut hers, but she cannot bring herself to do so because of her sister's unselfishness and because of the sheer beauty of her breasts.",

When Chifusa tells Kaede she shouldn't because it would slow down their progress, Kaede mistakes Chifusa's motivation and believes she doesn't want her to model because she is jealous, prompting her to abandon Chifusa. When they are about to start painting, Sakuji reveals he is a nude painter who only paints flat-chested models (which is why the three Manyu guards had attacked him) which shocks Kaede and makes her escape; though as soon as she leaves she is attacked by the three Manyu guards whom they had run into earlier. Sakuji finds them and tries to defend Kaede but is unable to beat the guards. The two are saved, however, when Chifusa arrives and easily defeats the attacking Manyu. Afterwards, with Chifusa's help, Sakuji makes a painting of Kaede which he considers his masterpiece.
