Though he based his attacks on a video game character, his power is not to be taken lightly! For this reason, he is number six in the Fukamichi Ranking. Maki definitely sees that he's not someone who will be beaten if she doesn't give 100%. At the same time, Kinjiro Kitaeda is fighting the 10th ranked fighter upon Fukamichi's instructions. He's being swiftly punched by his nimble opponent, but he responds with \"There's no soul in your punches\" and knocks him out in one blow. Fukamichi watches this all happen and even sees Yashiki, the 8th ranked fighter who can use the osmosis attack, be quickly overcome. We have a new rival here, folks! Meanwhile, Maki is reluctantly going to have her rematch with Shigeo. She is thinking up a special attack to finally beat him while watching a movie with Mina. A move to beat an opponent in one split second... Maki has an idea!",

He then realizes that he's been turned into a Shizuna-man! By the way, what's a Shizuna-man? Thinking his outfit looks stupid, Kin-chan takes off the pieces of the Shizuna-man armor one by one as Shizuna scowls at him like some sort of monster. Then, he realizes that he can use his left arm. Though he dislikes the outfit, he'd rather have that than not be able to use his arm. Reluctantly he strips down to the bare minimum amount of armor and goes to defeat the Air Master once again. Around the same time, the younger Fukamichi brother appears once again, this time challenging Maki to a fight. But this time he doesn't show himself and begins a fight in a showy blast of fireworks on top of a roof. At the same time, Kin-chan is out to challenge the Air Master. But this time Fukamichi declares that his opponent is the 4th ranked Minaguchi. Kinjiro suddenly gets angry proclaiming, \"I won't just do as you want me to!\"",

The truth is that Konishi is a judo master calling himself the Submission Hunter. The way he speaks is very odd. Honestly speaking, he's a strange guy. The fight begins quickly but what is surprising is the rate at which he knocks out Saeki's knees. When asked about his real background, Konishi admits to being in the Fukamichi Ranking. Wanting to know more, Saeki invites him out to a Korean barbeque restaurant. Konishi thought they'd talk while eating but Saeki isn't letting him eat the meat at all. This irritates Konishi. Their conversation doesn't work well either. Finally, Saeki admits that he can't enjoy eating his meal to the max when dining with a guy. As their conversation creeps further into absurdity, Renge shows up, bedazzled by the smell of the Korean barbeque.",
