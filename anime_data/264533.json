    "SummaryEnglish": "Otonokizaka High School stands on the border of three cities: Akihabara—a pop culture mecca that's evolving by the minute; Kanda—a conservative, cultured city where history and tradition reign supreme; and Jinbo—a quiet area reserved for a more mature, sophisticated population. Amidst this culture clash, the school now faces closure due to the enrollment of fewer and fewer students. With the school planning to close within three years, nine female students come together with one thing in mind—form a pop idol group to revive the school's popularity and keep it from shutting down. \"In order to protect our beloved school, there's only one thing we can do... become pop stars!\" Their goal is simple: Become an overnight sensation and use their nationwide media exposure to promote their school and bring in a wave of new students to the ailing area. A simple but solid plan, they figure. Naturally, they're nervous and wonder if this plan can really succeed, but for better or worse their new journey has begun...",

As Honoka decides to investigate UTX, she finds it attracts a lot of students due a school idol group known as A-Rise. Honoka decides that the best way to save her school is to start an idol group themselves, though Umi isn't keen on the idea. As Honoka becomes downhearted, she spots a talented singer and pianist and redoubles her efforts, whilst Umi inevitably gives in and joins Kotori in partaking in Honoka's idea. Despite their request to start an idol club being rejected by the student council president, Eli Ayase, Honoka remains determined to make it work.",

Honoka perks up when she hears the class is supporting her, as well as receiving a name for their group, μ's. Honoka once again approaches Maki, showing her how serious an idol's work is and giving her the lyrics Umi wrote. After a little advice from the student vice-president, Nozomi Toujou, she sends Honoka a CD of the song she composed from Umi's lyrics whilst also anonymously voting for μ's on an idol ranking site.",

Afterwards, Hanayo comes across Honoka's shop, where Umi and Kotori are also visiting as they notice a recording of their performance has gained a fair amount of views on the internet. Mentioning that even they have their flaws, the girls formally invite Hanayo to join the club, asking her to think it over. Noticing her shyness in class, Maki decides to help Hanayo learn to speak loudly.

After Niko rejects their offer of merging the groups, assumedly based on their lack of personas, student vice-president Nozomi Toujou explains how Niko had previously attempted to become a school idol but set the bar too high, leading it to fall apart.

With the girls divided between whether or not μ's should carry on with new members in the new year, Eli states that Honoka and the other younger members should be the ones to decide what the future of the group will be. Later, Alisa, who had originally wanted to join μ's upon entering Otonogizaka, tells Honoka that she instead intends to form her own idol unit with Yukiho, having realized that the reason she loves μ's is because of its nine members. Later that weekend, Honoka brings out the group to play, visiting all sorts of places that each of the members decide to go. Upon arriving at the beach, Honoka and the others announce their decision that μ's will disband after graduation, with everyone feeling the same way that a group with even one member missing is not μ's at all. After letting out all of their tears, the girls return home and make preparations for their final performance together at Love Live.",

Whilst Nico shows her family around, Honoka and the others work on preparations for the graduation ceremony. Honoka soon comes across Eli reminiscing in the student council room, and gives her thanks to all she has done for everyone. As the opening ceremony gets underway, Honoka presents her commemorative speech, which turns out to be a special song she and the others had prepared for the third years. After the ceremony, Nico assigns Hanayo as the next president for the Idol Research Club, with Maki nominated for vice-president, before the group take a reminiscing tour around the school. Arriving at the rooftop where everything began, Honoka gives a proper sendoff to the name of μ's. Before the girls can get a chance to part ways, Hanayo receives some 'big news', prompting everyone to rush back to the club room.",
